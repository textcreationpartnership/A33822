            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <p>HOW glad I am to ſee you, my dear Nephew (cried <hi>Dorante,</hi> in embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing <hi>Liſidor</hi>) and how farther joyful ſhould I be, could I prove ſerviceable to you in this Town?</p>

                        <p>You know, Sir, the occaſion of my coming, was, becauſe you was here; had it not been for this, thoſe that have the care of me, would never have conſented to this journey.</p>
                        <p>After theſe words <hi>Dorante</hi> made <hi>Liſidor</hi> enter into an <hi>Apartment</hi> he had provided for him, and having ordered the Collation to be brought in, he deſired him to ſit down, and thus conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued the diſcourſe.</p>

ſo greatly deſired to come into this Town. All young people deſire the ſame; for one may ſay, that <hi>Pairs</hi> is not only the Capital of a flouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Monarchy, but is even reſpected as the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominant City of all <hi>Europe.</hi> People come here from all parts, ſome to poliſh themſelves, others to get Employments, others to ſee the fineſt Court in the World, and the greateſt King on Earth. However, to be well acquainted with <hi>Paris</hi> requires time. Strangers are ſurprized in not finding immediately all the varieties they have been told of it; they ſeek them, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover only the leaſt part of them, as long as they ſee only the Streets and Buildings.</p>
                        <p>But how great is their admiration afterwards, when they enter into the Houſes, and view the magnificence of the Furniture? If they be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into the Company of Perſons of Wit and Merit which at certain hours meet together?</p>

                        <p>I profeſs, Sir, that I love <hi>Paris</hi> the more for that reaſon, and above all things wiſh I were capable of making one in theſe Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; but I am ſenſible how unfit I am for it.

                        <p>I know, Sir, how great a Maſter you are in the Art I would learn; and all the World

knows that your Age, which has yielded you Experience, has taken nothing from you of that agreableneſs, which makes the Charms of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation.</p>

                        <p>As I am naturally complaiſant, and that I love Company, you may hear ſomething in my commendation, and therefore I ſhall not by an unſeaſonable modeſty oppoſe my Friends opinion of me, ſeeing it may make you to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the advice I am deſired to give you with greater reliſh. It is at your Father's requeſt, Sir, that I have undertaken this Province, who is the deareſt of my Relations, and therefore you may eaſily imagine I ſhall uſe my utmoſt endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to ſatisfie both you and him. I much ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove of your deſign; for nothing is more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant in the commerce of life, than to pleaſe in Coverſation; and if men are born for Society, one may ſay that it is Converſation which is the Bond of Friendſhip. But I know not if be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we enter into matters which we ſhould treat of, I ſhould not ask you what you underſtand by the word Converſation?</p>
                     </sp>

                        <p>I am not at all diſpleaſed, Sir, you ask me this, ſeeing it will coſt you an explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for I confeſs, that although I comprehend what a Converſation is, yet I ſhould be perplex'd, ſhould you require a proper definition of it.</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>Dorante.</speaker>
                        <p>I am not at all ſurpriſed at what you ſay; I have ſeen in the ſame pain, perſons more experienc'd than you can be at your age. There are a great many diſtinctions to make hereupon, and every time ſeveral perſons ſpeak in theſe Aſſemblies, they form not what we call Converſation. Obſcure Sciences and great Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:60459:7"/>
muſt have a leſs ſhare in their diſcourſes, than agreeableneſs and diverſion. For in a fine, let a man treat gravely of important matters, in a Council of State or War, in a Law-ſuit or Diſtemper; where a Phyſician ſhall banter you with hard words, and a Lawyer cramp you with Preſidents; all this is no more a Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, than the Brawlings in publick Diſputes, or the Scolding of Fiſh Women.</p>

                     <sp>
                        <speaker>Liſidor.</speaker>
                        <p>What then, Sir, muſt there be no mention of Sciences, of the Court, of War, or Politicks, in the diſcourſes you mean.</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>Dorante.</speaker>
                        <p>So for am I from baniſhing the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects you ſpeak of, that I affirm they ſerve to uphold Converſation, and to render it more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive. The Palace or pleading places, have now and then ſuch Cauſes as furniſh the beſt Companies with entertainmnet. There are great Subornations, conteſted Marriages, and Divor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which give occaſion to ſome to Moralize, and to others to utter a thouſand witty Reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. However a Man would prove very trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſom, if, to make himſelf admired, he ſhould enter on particulariſing an important Subject, and diſcourſe of nothing elſe all the day long. It is variety which makes any thing agreeable, an air eaſie and remote from affectation, which is never tireſom; whereas ſhould a man diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe on a ſublime Subject with affected expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, you could not hearken long to him, without falling aſleep. Yet great Intereſts, and extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary events may find their place in moſt Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; provided they enter naturally, and be treated of with that capacity and modeſty they require. Particularly one is aſſured to pleaſe, if there be
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:60459:7"/>
News wanting, and you be the firſt that relates a conſiderable Marriage, the birth of a Prince, the gaining of a Battle, or the taking of a place. Men are generally pleaſed at the recital of Regulations which relate to the Peoples welfare, or the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying of Towns, and Fortifying of places. Add that we hearken with pleaſure to one who comes from Court, if ſhe deſcribes a Magnificent En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment, or a Faſhion that is not as yet known in Town. Yet thoſe recitals muſt not be long, the particulars muſt only be toucht on, wherein the chief of the Company may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd; and the moſt important advice I can give you, is to conſider always before whom you ſpeak. Without this precaution you'll be in danger of offending Perſons whom you would pleaſe; and therefore if you will believe me, you will never act the Philoſopher before young People, who deſire only to talk of Plays and fine Women; neither muſt you appear ſevere in a Ball before Ladies, who think of nothing but dancing and diverting themſelves. In fine, you muſt conſult Reaſon, which being your guide, I ſee few matters, but may be Subjects of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation. It's true one ought to ſpeak leſs of ones ſelf than any thing elſe. For what can we ſay of our ſelves; We ſhall make our ſelves ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous in diſplaying the good qualities we poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs. And can we have the Imprudence to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh our defects? Or ſhall we deaden the Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment in ſpeaking indifferent and ordinary things of our ſelves? Extend this Rule, if you pleaſe, to Domeſticks: An Husband muſt ſpeak little and modeſtly of his Wife; a Mother would little divert, ſhould ſhe give an account of the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:60459:8"/>
cryings of her Children, and the care which the Nurſes take of them; we muſt be no leſs retentive in citing the faults of our Servants. What matter is it to the Company, if we have a lame Footman, or a ſlovenly Cook, or a Stew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard that makes us pay dear for that which he buys cheap? We ſhould always obſerve what diverts, and what tires; and that it is eaſier to avoid a fault, than to acquire a perfection: Examine we preſently what may render a man troubleſom, and we ſhall ſoon perceive how to make a Spirit of gayety and politeneſs reign in Converſation. You have ſeen an agreeable repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation of theſe importunate people in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy of the <hi>Troubleſoms,</hi> and I doubt not but you have read the Converſations of a perſon who is generally eſteemed.</p>

                        <p>I have obſerv'd with pleaſure, in that Comedy, after what ſort one becomes trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom in making long diſcourſes, void of agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs, wherein the Company takes no part. I cannot endure that Man who pretends that his Prince ſhould recompence him with a Veſſel which he has loſt. He tells you, without any Mans offer to ask him, the Reaſons whereon his pretentions are grounded, and what may be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged againſt them, and the replies he can make thereto. He at lenght names thoſe who built his Ship, and deſcribes all the parts of a Veſſell, to ſhew that his was very fine and coſtly.</p>

I am not much intereſs'd to know that in a Family which is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:60459:8"/>
to me, that <hi>Thiband</hi> was the Son of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guerrand,</hi> and that <hi>Enguerrand</hi> had <hi>Guy</hi> for his Father. I find more diverting that Brave in the Comedy of <hi>George Andin,</hi> who tells us, that one of his Predeceſſors, named <hi>John Giles</hi> of <hi>Soten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville,</hi> had heretofore leave to ſell all his Goods to go beyond Sea.</p>

                        <p>I confeſs theſe Genealogical recitals are very tireſom; yet methinks not altogether ſo vexatious as thoſe Relations of tragical Events heapt up one upon another, eſpecially being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted with a lamentable tone, as if deſign'd to make us bewail all the ſad accidents which have hapned ſince the beginning of the world.</p>

                        <p>I grant you that nothing is more trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſom than theſe doleful Relations; but when a Man is about making them, you will not, I ſuppoſe, adviſe him to ſpeak fecetiouſly of them. Not that I think it always neceſſary to accommodate ones Words and Countenance to the Matter treated of. On the contrary, a Man cannot more eaſily raiſe a fit of Laughter, than in relating ſome pleaſant paſſage with a cold and ſerious air. There is likewiſe a certain turn of Language which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires one to ſpeak highly big of mean things, and to give a plain and ſimple relation of great and noble Subjects. You may eaſily perceive the Reaſon, for theſe latter bear up themſelves, and others have need of props. I ſuppoſe this is enough for this bout, having given you theſe general Advices, whereunto I may add, that in all ſorts of Entertainments, you muſt be ſure to avoid whatever may favour of Formality and Affectation.</p>

<pb n="8" facs="tcp:60459:9"/>
me ſuch a clearneſs of underſtanding, that if you continue to inſtruct me, perhaps you will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive ſuch ſucceſs, as will hinder you from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting it.</p>

                        <p>I can aſſure you my counſels will be of little uſe to you, unleſs you mix therewith the frequenting of Company, and making cloſe and conſtant Obſervations thereupon. The Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ims of the greateſt Maſters are not of themſelves able to make a compleat Gentlemen: A man becomes not a Painter, but by uſing the Pencil, how great a Judge ſoever he may be of good Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; and therefore I will not give you any Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ims for the world, unleſs you intend to ſee it. Theſe inſtructions will be fruitleſs to a Solitary; he can never acquire the facility of uſing them. The beſt Precepts and choiceſt Morals will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver take from him the perplext countenante which he brings from his Deſart. We can never take off that duſt and melancholly air of his Cell. But on the contrary, we may ſay, that advice gives great Aſſiſtance to perſons that take care to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe it. An hours reading is more profitable to theſe, than a whole year can be to contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive perſons who keep always in their Studies. A Man muſt practice immediately as ſoon as he is furniſh'd, with good Rules; and it is uſeful for a Man ever and anon to examine theſe Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, when he enters into Company. This Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caution makes known the faults wherein one may fall; and there are ſome of ſuch a nature, as to make a Man ridiculous for his whole life time, the firſt time he commits them. So that a Man cannot be too much cautioned againſt them.</p>

They went both of 'em into a Garden which <hi>Dorante</hi> had taken care of embelliſhing. <hi>Liſidor</hi> viewed the Flowers, a ſmall Fountain, and ſome Statues; and being afterwards fat down with <hi>Dorante</hi> in a pleaſant Arbor, this laſt reaſſumed his diſcourſe, and began this ſecond Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>

                        <p>BEfore we reaſſume our diſcourſe, you are deſirous, I ſuppoſe, dear Nephew, that we ſhould ſay ſomething touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the being handſomly cloath'd before you ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in the Companies wherein I pretend to bring you. I do not think you have made you Cloaths before your departure, nor that you eſteem your Taylors ſo as to prefer them to ours. We will go to morrow morning, if you think fitting, to find out what is moſt modiſh and proper for a perſon of your years and condition. You know we muſt not neglect the outſide. We ſhould always ſo order it, that the firſt impreſſions turn to our advantage, and diſpoſe people the better to reliſh the Sentiments of our mind, and the agreeable products of our Fancies. That which does farther contribute to theſe favourable diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:60459:10"/>
is a certain manner of behaviour and ſpeech that is ſoft and poliſht, which gives the name of civil to thoſe which commonly uſe them.</p>
                        <p>You know what are the Qualities which that which we call Civility requires; and you have obſerved without doubt, That that of our French, and the Urbanity of the Ancient Romans, draw their original from two words which ſignifie <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> and <hi>Villa.</hi> And we almoſt ever ſee that the perſons who have been brought up in Cities, have an handſom behaviour oppoſite to that which we call <hi>Ruſticity</hi> in Country People.</p>

                        <p>If you pleaſe, Sir, tell me in what manner one may practice this civility, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it conſiſts?</p>

                        <speaker>Dorante.</speaker>
                        <p>The moſt important Rule which I would give in this matter, were I fit to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted, ſhould be, that a Man who would gain on affections, ſhould carry tokens of Modeſty in his countenance and behaviour. He cannot draw envy, unleſs he appears poſſeſs'd in a good opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of himſelf; and on the contrary, he cannot but be pleaſing to Company, if, inſtead of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing fierce and poſitive, he gives them marks of eſteem and ſubmiſſion.</p>
                        <p>I would have one alſo to obſerve exactly a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent behaviour, according to the Sex, Age, and Quality of the perſon you converſe with, with regard likewiſe both to time and place. In effect, a Lady would be but little charming, ſhould ſhe appear with the bluſtering meen of a Souldier; neither would a Captain look well, if he affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to ſpeak ſoft and fine, like a Sir <hi>Courtly Nice;</hi> and an old Man would be ridiculous,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:60459:10"/>
ſhould he look on his Toes, and ever and anon throw back the locks of his Peruke, like a young <hi>Beau</hi> of eighteen. Now to come to another kind of men; wou'd you ſpeak to a great Prelate, or to a grave Magiſtrate, with as mimic an Air as to a Chamber-fellow in the Academy? We muſt allow that Decency requires that we not only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have our ſelves reſpectfully with perſons of a diſtink Rank, but even not ſo much as to ſpeak of them in any manner which ſavours of equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. I do not believe that a perſon who has been of the Retinue of an Ambaſſador in his Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels, will be ſo ridiculous as to ſay in his ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Diſcourſe, <hi>When my Lord the Duke</hi> d'Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tree <hi>and I went to</hi> Rome <hi>together:</hi> Yet there are People, who ſpeaking to a great Lord, obſerve ſo little diſtance as to ſay; <hi>You remember, Sir, what befell us when we ſet out for</hi> Lyons; whereas they ſhould have mentioned only the Lord's name, and barely have ſaid, <hi>When my Lord Duke</hi> d'Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtree <hi>went to</hi> Rome; and as to the ſecond expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, <hi>When your Lordſhip parted.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I do not tell you that there are an infinite number of other Rules to be followed by a Man that would appear like a Gentlemann. You know that we muſt not only give the right hand and the wall to perſons of Quality, but likewiſe yield them generally whatever ſeems moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious. Your own Reaſon will ſhew you what is fitting in theſe matters, without my ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.

                           <pb n="12" facs="tcp:60459:11"/>I might moreover inſert ſome one of theſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts in our Entertainments: Should I collect them all at preſent, you would be perhaps diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſted at them. Let us firſt conſider thoſe which are to be obſerved in entring into Company. When you go to ſee a perſon of a Rank above yours, you know, without doubt, that it is to uſe too much familarity, to enter with your Coach or Chair into the Court of his houſe. Civility requires we come out of them to enter on foot, unleſs the Porter, by his Maſter's order, opens the great Gate, and entreats you to enter more commodiouſly. If you be not known, and your name be ask'd, you are only barely to mention it, without adding thereto your Title of Marqueſs, or Sir <hi>John.</hi> You likewiſe are not to be taught, that when we find the Chamber door faſtned, it's not civil to knock loudly with your ſtick, but rather ſoftly with your knuckles, or ſcratching the door. This faſhion came from the doors of the <hi>Louvre,</hi> and is now gotten to thoſe of the Miniſters and Grandees of the Court, and I doubt not but it will get by degrees to all Houſes where there is any Quality. But when a Man firſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents himſelf, commonly he whoſe office is to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce perſons, takes care of leveling theſe lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle difficulties.</p>

                        <p>However there is one; for when we find perſons already at the door, or there come any before it be opened, Civility requires one to withdraw, to let them firſt enter who came be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us, and offer the door even unto thoſe who came after, if they appear to be perſons of any Conſideration. However this does not free me from my perplexity; for if I be not known to
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:60459:11"/>
thoſe Perſons; how far am I obliged to carry on my Civility, or, to ſpeak better, this kind of Ceremony?</p>

                        <p>There is on the Countenance and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour, certain Characters which may make us gueſs at the Condition of Perſons; and which determins us to treat them with more or leſs Civility, according as our Conjectures ſhall di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect us. But when a Man that wants Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and Penetration, finds himſelf in the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty you ſpeak of, he muſt take the ſureſt ſide, which is, to pay more reſpects than we think are due, ſeeing it is better that People who are not worthy of them, ſhould be obliged to us for 'em, than to expoſe our ſelves to diſoblige Perſons who merit more Civility than we have paid them. Yet we muſt not fall into thoſe Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies which were ſo incommodious in the former Court. They have been long ſince ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſht, and we can hardly believe Men ſhould make it an Art to torture themſelves and others.</p>

                        <p>It's true, one would wonder how we could reliſh them, for the <hi>French</hi> are too mercurial to remain whole hours in a ſtate of complementing.

However the famous Monſieur <hi>de la Care</hi> tells us, that the Ceremonies paſt from <hi>Spain</hi> to <hi>Italy;</hi> but ſuppoſing this were true, and that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> have taken them from the <hi>Moors</hi> of <hi>Granade,</hi> as well as their Gallan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, yet I muſt ſtill believe, that they rather come from <hi>Italy,</hi> than from any other Nation.

                        <p>I ſuppoſe the word Ceremony is not ancient; and that it may have come from that given to reſpectful Actions which Church-men make uſe of to denote the Honour they give to God, or to Holy Things.</p>
                     </sp>

                        <p>I am of the ſame Opinion as you: We have extended in proceſs of time the ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of this Term. It has been thought fit to apply it to the Reverences which men make to one another, in bowing down, in uncovering the Head, and by accompanying theſe Actions with an hundred other Grimaces, the more to te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie our Submiſſion. This Cuſtom is but the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:60459:13"/>
ſhadow of what it was, and it is well for us it is ſo.</p>
                        <p>However it is not ſo much abaſed, but that it endeavours to raiſe up its Head. But thoſe Perſons as know the World, retrench all theſe Superfluities, and obſerve only what Decency requires. Hereby they fall not into fruitleſs Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of Words, and Submiſſions, which are ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom taken for ſincere. And therefore they be commonly uſed to flatter in appearance ſuch Perſons as we do in effect deſpiſe.</p>
                        <p>To proceed farther; all theſe Ceremonies, and theſe Proteſtations of Amity, would not only be look'd upon as ſo many Diſſimulations, but one might look upon them as Crimes and Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheries; if thoſe Terms, which are at every turn uſed, had not loſt their firſt Validity through long Cuſtom. But we are wont no longer to take theſe in a ſtrict ſenſe. We ſee every day People embrace one another, kiſs, and make a thouſand offers, as if they were the beſt Friends in the world; and who, a moment afterwards acknowledge, without Heſitation, that they ſcarce knew one another. However we muſt follow this Cuſtom, inſtead of attempting to change it. It is leſs our Fault than the Fault of our Age; and all that wiſe People can do, is, to uſe it with moderation and diſcretion. When all the world falls into a Fault, no body can be blamed; and how extravagant ſoever a Mode may be, a Man would yet be ſtill more extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant, if he refuſed to comply with it. Should he alone offer to withſtand the general Conſent of his Country. Let us grant therefore, that there are Ceremonies of Duty from which we
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:60459:13"/>
cannot fairly excuſe our ſelves, but offend Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who will imagine we pay 'em not their Dues. So that the Authority of Cuſtom may do all things in point of Ceremony; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it muſt be regarded as a kind of Law. Let not a Man examine whether this Law be good or bad, it is ſufficient it has obtain'd, whereby we are obliged to obey it; and therefore it's ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to know after what manner we ſhould carry our ſelves, and what terms we ſhould uſe in receiving Viſits, how to return them, and to ſalute according to the Cuſtom of the Country. Great is the variety of expreſſion in theſe rencoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters: Among us Civility requires we ſhould uſe the plural in ſpeaking to a ſingle perſon; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps to ſignifie to him, that we eſteem him as much as many others.</p>
                        <p>Addreſſing our ſelves to a Perſon of ordinary rank, yet we accoſt him with, <hi>I pray you,</hi> Sir; whereas the ancient Romans ſaid, <hi>I pray thee.</hi> Which way of ſpeaking is ſtill amongſt ſome Nations. The <hi>Turks,</hi> who are ſo ſubmiſſive to their Soveraigns, whoſe mean Slaves they term themſelves, yet uſe theſe kind of expreſſions when they ſpeak to him, <hi>If thy Highneſs commands it,</hi> &amp;c. And heretofore in <hi>Spain, Amirante</hi> uſed the word <hi>thou</hi> in ſpeaking to the King of <hi>Arragon;</hi> and we ſee that the Subjects of moſt Princes ſpeak in a quite different manner: <hi>Amirante</hi> followed the Cuſtom of his Country, and we ought to obey the Cuſtom of ours.</p>

However ſeeing you are pleaſed that I ſhould entertain you about her, I will do it, and inſtead of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting her as my Wife, I ſhall only conſider her as a Figure, to the end you may love her without any ſcruple.</p>
                        <p>An Hyperbole has commonly only exceſſive ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, ſhe augments or diſtinguiſhes things in exceſs; but if it be permitted her to go beyond the bounds of Truth, yet ſhe muſt never paſs thoſe of reſemblance to truth. You know how I have
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:60459:24"/>
treated of this elſewhere; and <hi>Liſidor,</hi> not hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſeen the paſſage I ſpeak of, I need only repeat what the Idea which I ſtill retain will furniſh me with. I cannot forget a bold ſtroke I gave, which perhaps will never be pardoned me.</p>
                        <p>I ſaid that <hi>Virgil</hi> went too far, when he ſet forth the lightneſs of <hi>Camilla;</hi> and that I knew not whether in ſo great a Poem, one might make a Princeſs run over the tops of Corn with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out bending them, and over the Waves of the Sea, without wetting the ſoles of her Feet. Theſe are in truth gliſtering expreſſions, but I think 'em not ſo well placed in a ſerious ſtile, as they would be in a light Poem.</p>
                        <p>There are alſo Authors, who think they carry not their Exageration far enough, if they do not heap Hyperbole upon Hyperbole. Now although there are infinite Hyperbolies in the Writings of witty Men, who are pleaſed to ſport ingeniouſly with them, yet we muſt not think this Figure ought to be only uſed in raillery, and that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not well be ſeen in the moſt ſerious matters.

                        <p>
                           <hi>But my Lord, as there was heretofore a Valiant Man who could not receive any wounds, but on the fears of thoſe he had already received, ſo you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be praiſed, but by Repetitions; ſeeing that truth, which has its bounds, has ſaid for you, whatever falſhood, which knows none, has inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for others.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I may add, that Hyperboles make a great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion in a Tragical Subject. <hi>This Monſter hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not ſufficiently glutted his Cruelty; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

                        <p>I confeſs in thoſe days I made more often uſe of the Hyperbole, than the Irony; but ſeeing I find my ſelf at preſent in a calmer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:60459:25"/>
I ſhould be more diſpoſed to Gaiety than the Figure requires, which you would have me ſpeak of. You know better than I, what a great reliſh ſhe yields to Raillery, and I believe that <hi>Liſidor</hi> is not to be taught that an Irony conſiſts in learning neatly to be underſtood, the contrary of what we ſay. I ſaw yeſterday at a Lady of Quality's a Marqueſs, who this day was to ſet out for his Province, where he goes to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine himſelf. He came to <hi>Paris</hi> on occaſion of a Law ſuit, and I believe he returns leſs out of humour for having parted with a great deal of money to Solicitors, and Lawyers, than to have remain'd three or four Months from his Seat and his Farms. He took a great delight in recount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing how he buſied himſelf in the Country; and being my near Kinſman, I could no more ſuffer what he ſaid, than his manner of living. A La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the Company took notice of the Pain I was in, and repreſented, to the Marqueſs; That in <hi>France</hi> a Perſon of Quality thought it more becoming him to ſerve in the Wars, than to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muſe himſelf in feeding Ducks and Pigeons. Our Country Gentleman ſmiled, and ſhewed by his anſwer, That he pitied thoſe Perſons that ſerv'd in the Wars. I could not then forbear ſpeaking, and directing my diſcourſe to this La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, My Lord has reaſon (ſaid I to her a little roughly) and I aſſure you that the <hi>Conde's,</hi> the <hi>Turenne's,</hi> and the <hi>Crequi's,</hi> are to be blamed for not following his Example. Their lives would have been Glorious far from Armies; whereas they determined to ſpend them in beat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Enemies, gaining Battles, and taking Cities. I know not what they thought in embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:60459:25"/>
a profeſſion which ſo greatly leſſens their Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. It's true, they had the miſhap of not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting a Wit ſo ſolid as that of my Lord the Marqueſs. I uttered theſe words with a ſerious Air, the Company ſmiled, and my Kinſman loſt his Countenance, and could not get it again all the Dinner time.</p>
                        <p>I do not doubt but <hi>Liſidor</hi> knows, That we comprehend the ſenſe of an Irony, either by a tone of Pronunciation which diſcovers that we are not in earneſt, or by the apparent oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion there is between the words and the thing ſpoken of. It was by this laſt means that I was underſtood; for they ſaw nothing but what was ſerious in my Diſcourſe and on my Countenance. But ſeeing that you have cited Authors, methinks it is lawful for me to ſay, That an Irony gliſters throughout all the Works of <hi>Voiture</hi> and <hi>Saraſin.</hi> You are not ſurpriſed at this, but I am, in ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in <hi>Malherbe</hi>'s Letters a Raillery ingeniouſly turn'd, which I may take for a kind of Irony. I was ſo content with ſeveral paſſages of this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Author's Rhime, that I dared not read his Proſe, ſo greatly was I afraid of loſing the Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teem I would preſerve for him. <hi>Liſidor</hi> will not be diſpleaſed in hearing how ingeniouſly <hi>Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herbe</hi> relates the News of the Siege of <hi>Vertue.</hi>

I believe that the</hi> Spaniards <hi>will ſee the Steeples and Chimneys of this Town; but as for the Streets of it, they muſt get their notices of them in the Map.

In fine, every body takes the Pencil in hand; but I know not whether there be many</hi> Apelles<hi>'s among this great number of Painters. Yet it is certain, that a Mediocrity is not excuſable in theſe ſort of works, for labouring therein leſs through neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, than for Ornament, every thing ſhould gliſter therein, and nothing ſhould appear languiſhing.</hi> One may deſcribe or make a Recital in two dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent manners; The firſt Natural, Simple, and Succinct; The other more Extenſſive and Flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing. If the diſpute be touching the Waters of a River, as to the right which may be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for the watering of Meadows, or turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Mills; a Man need only relate preciſely the circumſtances, which may ſerve to give light into the diſpute. But if I ſpeak not of this River, but to deſcribe a delicate place, I may then expatiate, and ſay, <hi>That it's Chryſtal Waters wind themſelves about a delightful Valley, either to water it in the more places, or to ſhew that they are pleaſed with it, and leave it with regret.</hi> It is in theſe occaſions that Poetry may triumph, provided ſhe uſes, with a lively Fancy, and a
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:60459:27"/>
ſolid Judgment, the priveledge ſhe has of ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her ſelf bolder, and leſs reſerv'd than in Proſe. And therefore, in this laſt manner of making a deſcription, or a recital, I ſhould for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get none of the Circumſtances which may give any reliſh to what I undertook to recount. If it were an Hiſtory, or ſome adventure of thoſe great Fables which have diverted our Nation, under the name of Romance, I would endeavour to paint my Hero's in a moſt exact manner. Thoſe who were to here me repreſenting them, ſhould make, if I may ſo ſay, ſuch a kind of acquaintance with them, as would engage them to hearken to me, and induce them at the ſame time to take part in whatever regards the Perſons I ſhould entertain them with.</p>

                        <p>Perhaps you ſaw too many of them. The Author, you ſpeak of, has gathered together as many on the the banks of the <hi>Rhine,</hi> as the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs <hi>d'Urfe</hi> did Shepherds on the banks of <hi>Lignon:</hi> However you may eaſily judge there are ſomething fewer Kings than Shepherds, yet we may juſtifie <hi>Calprenede</hi> in ſome ſort. The Romances he ſet forth were like Epic Poems in Proſe. They had more of the <hi>Illiad</hi> and <hi>Enead</hi> than the <hi>Theagenes</hi> and <hi>Aſtrea.</hi> Moreover the Age of <hi>Faramond</hi> permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him to mention thoſe great number of Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigns. It was after the death of the great <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odoſius;</hi> and as his Children ſucceeded not in his Valour, and that they weakned the Empire in ſharing it, ſo an infinite number of Barbarous
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:60459:27"/>
Nations took that time to ſettle themſelves in better Countries than their own. Theſe Nations march'd under Leaders who were Kings, or to whom one might give this Title, which <hi>Homer</hi> has ſo prodigally beſtowed on ſo many Greeks. As for the Characters, I confeſs they are a little too uniform in the writings of <hi>Calprenede.</hi> We find none therein but brave and fierce Blades; whereas there ſhould be variety, to give reliſh to a Recital, and to render it more probable.</p>

As for a bold Action, we ſhould deſcribe a ſtrong Man, brought up in the Wars, of an aſſured Countenance, and a grim Aſpect. But if I may again ſpeak of the Expreſſions which we ſhould uſe, I would ſay they muſt be Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, without Flatneſs, a kind of Nobleneſs and Elevation in them; according as the matters re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, but nothing flatulent or forc'd. A Man ſhould baniſh Equivocal Terms and Tranpoſitions, and uſe only Parentheſes through Neceſſity and with Judgment; and retrench all thoſe Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances which ſerve neither to inſtruct nor delight.</p>

                        <p>Speaking freely, as we do in theſe matters, we may add ſomething as to the choice
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:60459:28"/>
of words. It is not enough to uſe thoſe which are propereſt to give the Idea of what we would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent, we muſt alſo know the Terms which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to Arts, whether our Recital relates to mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters concerning Painting or Sculpture, War or Navigation.</p>
                        <p>This Remark brings to my remembrance a brisk Anſwer which an Officer of our Fleet made to a young Gentleman of this Town, who made one Campaign on his Veſſel. The <hi>Pariſian</hi> walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one night on the Bridge to take the Air; Pray, Sir, ſays he, let's be gone, the wind is very high, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Sir, ſays the Officer, know that for a Sea-man to ſay, The wind is very high, is a very great abſurdity; ſeeing the term is, It is foul, or hard weather.</p>
                        <p>Although we muſt uſe terms proper to Arts, yet it is not neceſſary to be ſo ſcrupulous as a Phyſician of my acquaintance was the other day. Having called to him a Chirurgion who was in the Sick Man's Chamber: You muſt not fail, ſays he, to Phlebotomiſe the Gentleman to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row morning. I will never ſuffer it, (cried out the Sick Man in a fright) and I am not, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued he, in ſo bad a condition to have recourſe to ſo dreadful an operation. The Chirurgion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying immediately thereupon (that he might not loſe his little profit,) Sir, ſaid he to the ſick Gentleman, be not troubled, the Doctor only orders a bleeding. Ah for bleeding, replied he, I matter it little, but for the reſt, I will as ſoon dye as endure it.</p>

                        <p>Do you think it enough to have ſpoken of words which ſignifie preciſely what we have to ſay, or which are proper to Arts?
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:60459:28"/>
Is it not alſo fitting to find Terms which may neatly encloſe the things which we would have underſtood, and which modeſty will not permit us to expreſs openly; Should I not do better in ſaying, There is a ſecret Correſpondence between the Marqueſs of—and the Counteſs of— than to explain my ſelf too groſſy on the manner of their Commerce? It is alſo fitting in theſe occaſions to heed the tone of the voice, and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſmiles, which may make us too well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, and tranſgreſs thoſe poliſh'd manners which a well-bred Man ſhould never forget.</p>
                        <p>I find likewiſe that there are expreſſions which Gentlemen ſhould uſe when there happens ſome conteſt between them. If any one ſhould make me repeat ſome circumſtance of a Recital, and he ſhould tell me he did not hear me, I would not anſwer him; <hi>That it is your fault, not mine; I ſpeak plain enough, but I cannot make my ſelf be heard when I am not hearkned to.</hi> Politeneſs requires ſofter terms, <hi>Perhaps, Sir, I am miſtaken; let's ſee, if you pleaſe, whether I did not ſay that,</hi> &amp;c. Civility likewiſe requires that we make not too vehement reproaches, nor too preciſe, whenever one has fail'd of his word given. So that inſtead of complaining againſt one, that has not perform'd his promiſe, I ſhould chuſe to ſay; <hi>That I hoped he would do it; but that I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed he either forgot his promiſe, or met with more difficulty in the thing than he foreſaw.</hi>

                        <p>This is commonly the fault of young people: But they commit a far greater, when they laugh at a Stranger who does not ſpeak our Language well; or run down in his preſence the Vices of his Nation.</p>

                        <p>Neither ought one to ſcoff at certain defects before perſons who have the like; and likewiſe a poliſh'd Man does not directly praiſe the perſons to whom he ſpeaks. He does it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licately; whereas people, that know not the world, give praiſes with ſo little addreſs, and with ſo great exceſs, that they perplex and put to the bluſh thoſe they think to oblige. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto we may add, That a Man who excels in his profeſſion, muſt not preſently ſpeak of it; and when he does, it muſt be with great modeſty, and when the Converſation turns on that hinge.</p>
                        <p>In fine, There are ſeveral things requiſite to form this Politeneſs, which makes the chief a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeableneſs of Converſation. And there needs no fewer to make a recital which may draw the attention, and pleaſe, and even (as it were) enchant thoſe who hearken to it. Beſides what
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:60459:29"/>
we have ſaid touching the choice, and placing of words, beauty of expreſſions, and lively de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions to be inſerted; it is neceſſary there ſhould be novelty, or ſomething marvellous in what we recount; that we ſhould have ready in our Memories, not only the main of the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, but alſo the names of perſons and places, leſt we heſitate in ſearching them.</p>
                        <p>There are Authors, who find it advantageous to make a relation of a Perſon known by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect we reprehend: as of a covetous Man known by his Covetouſneſs. I acknowledge, that thoſe who hearken have more pleaſure, when we cite a Perſon of their acquaintance, becauſe they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent him ſuch as he is; but I ſhould always chuſe to be leſs diverting, and more civil, and deny my ſelf and others that pleaſure, than to diſoblige any one. So that it is better to invent names for the Perſons who are to be concerned in a Recital, and even to lay the Scene of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture in another Town, than where we dwell.</p>

                        <hi>DOrante</hi> and <hi>Liſidor</hi> had no ſooner ſupt, but the firſt began the diſcourſe in this manner. We cannot be excuſed from going to morrow to <hi>Eraſtus;</hi> but although I uſe freedom with him, yet we will diſcourſe to night of certain poliſh'd and reſpectful manners with which it is fit to appear before Ladies. You know, without doubt, that nothing makes a young Gentleman ſo much valued, as the approbation of a Lady of merit; and that nothing more hinders Perſons of your Age from falling into irregularities, than the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiting Perſons whoſe ſentiments incline ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily to Virtue. In the mean time, ſpeak we of the precautions it is neceſſary you be furniſh'd with for this viſit; and let me begin by an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice which perhaps you little expect, which is on the manner of making an honour. You are perſwaded, without doubt, That your Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:60459:30"/>
Maſter has omitted nothing he ought to tell you hereupon; and I am likewiſe willing to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve you ſalute with a better Grace than he that taught you to ſalute. I know that moſt Maſters are too formal in theſe matters; They bow down, and raiſe themſelves up by rule only. Every thing is ſtarch'd in them, all ſavours of Art, and ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have they ended their Reverence, but they ſeem to promiſe the beginning of a <hi>Courant</hi> or <hi>Minuet.</hi> Perſons of Quality on the contrary, ſalute with a better Air, and in a more natural manner. If you feel ſtill any kind of conſtraint, you muſt get rid of it as ſoon as you can, and give to your countenance and action all requiſite liberty. Remember then, if you pleaſe, That we muſt always endeavour to do with a good grace what may draw the firſt reſpects of Perſons we addreſs our ſelves to. Nothing af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards renders us more agreeable than Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaiſance: It is this which makes up the Charms of Society; without it we muſt neither expect friendſhip among Men, nor a diverting Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation in Company, nor any part at play, or in a walk, or any other diverſion. But when I ſay we muſt be complaiſant, I do not mean, That baſe and ſervile Complaiſance which <hi>Juvenal</hi> attributes to certain Greeks of his time, who made their Court at <hi>Rome.</hi> It muſt be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd, ſays he, that this Nation is very comical. Do you ſay it is hot, they wipe the Sweat off their Forehead. Do you complain it is cold; they call for their furr'd Gown. There are then ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral complaiſances which one muſt not have. It is not lawful to betray our ſentiments in eſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al things, nor to favour Vice in any occaſion what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever.
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:60459:31"/>
One may ſhew the reſpect we have for great Perſons and Ladies, but we muſt never ſhew them a Complaiſance which may be prejudicial to them. They will no ſooner perceive it, but they will hate and deſpiſe us.</p>

                        <p>I conceive that Complaiſance is good in a thouſand particulars, and that no Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion could be kept up long without it. However I know not whether Converſation would not dye, if Complaiſance reigned too abſolutely in a Company, and every body will'd the ſame thing; whereas it becomes lively and inſtructive, as ſoon as an ingenious debate encourages us to maintain different opinions. So that I would willingly know in what bounds one may include a commendable Complaiſance, imagining that it conſiſts in a Medium, between two vitious ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treams, like other Virtues.</p>

                        <p>We may without fear of being blam'd, prefer, through Complaiſance, one pleaſure to another, as play before walking, and of Plays the choice of that which ſhall beſt pleaſe the Perſon for whom we have a deference. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever our Complaiſance muſt not turn to our no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table prejudice, nor be prejudicial to Perſons for whom we muſt not have ſo much Complaiſance, as to play at a play which a Perſon of great Quality may like, without any Skill in it, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our Complaiſance might be ſuſpected of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt. It will be generous, if we know not ſo well the Game as the Perſon of Quality who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gages us to play; however we muſt never ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe our ſelves to the undergoing a loſs, which may incommode us; for this laſt Complaiſance will be liable to be ridiculed.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="41" facs="tcp:60459:31"/>The beſt effect of Complaiſance is to make us endure the weakneſs of a Friend, and not to yield to Anger when he is diſordered by it. Far from provoking him, by earneſtly withſtanding what he deſires, we ſhould immediately ſeem to yield to him, and oppoſe only Sentiments full of Sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to the violence of his Paſſion. But there are ſeveral Complaiſances which I can never approve of: We may obſerve one, which may be called Univerſal, which makes Men ſay, <hi>Yes,</hi> to all ſorts of things, without diſtinction; and this appears to me to be ſuch a ſorry Humour, that I ſhould like better to be ſharply conteſted with.</p>
                        <p>I find no leſs incommodious that which the Citizens have one for another. It is ordinarily attended with long Compliments, and never en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Ceremonies.</p>

                        <p>The Complaiſances you mention, may diſpleaſe; but they deceive no body; whereas thoſe of the Court ſerve commonly only to make one take falſe Meaſures. A great Lord promiſes all, and a quarter of an hour after, he does not ſo much as remember that he made any Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe. So that all we get by theſe fair words, is the vexation of renouncing the Hopes we were made to conceive.</p>

                        <p>The Complaiſance which one has for Back-biters is yet more pernicious; for this is a ſacrificing thoſe who are abſent, and the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding a Vice which all generous Perſons deteſt. I find this Complaiſance ſo mean, ſo criminal, that I think it needleſs to ſay any thing more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it; being perſwaded you can never be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of falling into it. Let us rather return to the Subject which has caſt us on this matter, and
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:60459:32"/>
let us ſay, That the Complaiſance which we ought to have for Ladies has Bounds large e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough. You know that Men are weak, but with reſpect which we owe to Women: we may ſay they are yet weaker, and more credulous than we. As they are ordinarily prepoſſeſs'd with a good Opinion of themſelves, ſo they, like thoſe who flatter this Self love, and cannot bear with any body that ſhall diſabuſe them. A ſolid Friend who ſhould undertake to open their Eyes, will ſoon be caſt off for a Friend; and I have found it more than once, That they put a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere Perſon on very vexatious Trials. Not that I would be ſo ſcrupulous to contradict them in matters of ſmall moment. On the contrary, I would give to the Defects which they might have, the Names of the Virtues which come neareſt them: I would call Covetouſneſs, Fruga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity: I would commend in a lean Lady the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of her Shape; and I would endeavour to commend the ample Corpulency of Madam <hi>Bou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville (a great fat Woman in</hi> Scarron<hi>'s Comical Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance</hi>) by ſaying ſhe was in good plight. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times one muſt declare himſelf ſmitten with the golden Colour of Red, otherwhiles with the Brown, and Black, all being to be commended, according to the Companies wherein a Man ſhall find himſelf. If it be permitted to have this flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering Complaiſance for Ladies, you judge you muſt not fail to practiſe, when with them, the Precept of never ſpeaking of a Defect before Perſons who may have the like. To ſpeak all in two words, let's ſay in general, That to be complaiſant, it is good to conſult the Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance and Humour of the Perſon whom we
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:60459:32"/>
would pleaſe, and that we do in ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner conform our ſelves thereto, that ſhe may not doubt of the part we take in what concerns her.</p>
                        <p>I think we have talk'd enough of theſe mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters for to day: it is late, and you have need of Reſt.</p>

                        <p>Being to dine at a Friend's, I make no men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to you of certain Ceremonies touching waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with Perſons of great Rank. He muſt be very ignorant of the World, who ſhall draw near to the Baſin at the ſame time a Prince or great Man ſhall dine in the ſame company. You muſt ſtay till he entreats you to advance, or by taking you by the hand, or by ſome ſign denoting he intends you this honour. Then you are to ſhew, by a reſpectful bowing of the body, that it is only out of obedience to his commands that you offer to waſh with him; but in waſhing at <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſtus</hi>'s, the Servants come not immediately to

take the Towel, Civility requires you hold it till the Officer be preſent, or <hi>Eraſtus</hi> himſelf takes it out of your hands. It is his part not to ſuffer you in this poſture. You may ſtay till <hi>Cleonice</hi> places you; but I believe it will be more neat for you to place your ſelf at the lower end of the Table, to avoid Ceremonies.

                        <p>I have obſerv'd it an hundred times in my life, though I am not very old. I have ſeen People caſt their eyes greedily on the meat, as it were to devour it before they came to it; and ſcarce were the ſat down, but they ſnatch'd up what they liked. They reach'd over their hands into the fartheſt diſhes, without minding whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they ought to ſtretch their arms over other meats, and before Perſons to whom they ow'd reſpect. I have alſo obſerv'd, that in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the repaſt, there are ſome who bend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves over their Plates, as it were, to keep them in their fight, or to eat there with their Eyes, what they cannot hand up quick enough to their Mouths. Theſe are a ſort of People who bow continually, who excite others to eat and drink, and who endeavour to change the Mirth of a Feaſt into Fury. They put all into Diſorder; they imagine to bring greater Honour to the Treat, and the more trouble and confuſion they cauſe, the more they think the Maſter of the Houſe is obliged to them. I have known others, who diſdain to make uſe of Spoons and Forks, as much as if they were not made for their uſe: Their Knuckles are indifferently in every Diſh, and by this means they quickly make their Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers

By the firſt Defect a Man ſhews himſelf little accuſtomed to good Tables, or too greedy of the good Chear; and by the other, he ſeems to deſpiſe whatever Obligations the Maſter of the Feaſt intends to lay on him. Neither would I have a Man to ſpeak with great earneſtneſs of the Meat he loves beſt, or thoſe which he cannot endure; there are certain affected Reliſhes, which are on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tolerable in Women.</p>

<pb n="49" facs="tcp:60459:34"/>
judge whether theſe Exceſſes are agreeable to the Politeneſs we diſcourſe of; and whether a Man whoſe Reaſon is drowned in Wine, can have an agreeable Converſation? Is it not a ſhame to make it a point of Honour, to empty more Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles than the reſt of the Company, without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering that in this ridiculous Conteſt, the gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanteſt Man of the Court, cannot excel a Porter or Carman? You know the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> took a particular Care to inſpire an Averſion to Drunkenneſs.

Let not any one tell me, that a Man is willing to ſhew that he has a ſtrong Head: It is in other ſort of occaſions we ſhould give Proof of that; and not weaken our Heads, when all that is required of us, is only to be chearful, and obſerve Moderation. Let's draw a Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence which relates to our ſubject, and affirm that a Converſation cannot be agreeable during a Repaſt, nor immediately after, if we introduce exceſſive Drinking, and a tumultuous Noiſe.</p>

                        <p>I am perhaps leſs a woman in this matter, than you think I am; and I profeſs ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely, that a prating Goſſip is the more intolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable. Women have commonly their minds leſs cultivated than Men. They ſpeak fewer things with more words, and leave a greater Vacuum
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:60459:36"/>
in a diſcourſe. To prove this, I need only tell you what a Chagrin I had at a viſit I receiv'd yeſterday; it was <hi>Arpalice</hi> that gave it me. She entred into my Chamber, with a languiſhing Air, and complain'd immediately of an oppreſſion at her Stomack, which ſhe ſaid filled her with bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding apprehenſions; ſo that, continued ſhe, you'll pardon a poor infirm Creature, who is forbid to ſpeak, if ſhe endeavours to teſtifie to you the joy ſhe has to ſee young <hi>Lindamire</hi> is truly worthy to be your Siſter. I proteſt, adds ſhe again, that it is only in this occaſion that I am glad to diſpence with a ſilence, which I take pleaſure in obſerving in every other Rencounter.</p>
                        <p>I am far from the humour of thoſe Women who will talk on continually; when there's one that begins a diſcourſe, the reſt of the company muſt be ſilent till night; but, in fine, what can ſhe talk of all this while? would it not be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to take breath a little, and let others have their turns? When ſhe has ſhew'd her Petticoat, and made the colour be approved of, what mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is it to the Company that ſhe bought the Stuff at the Crown or Blackamore's-head; That this Stuff has coſt 4 Guineys more, or 4 leſs than the juſt Price. Muſt this prating Goſſip ſhew her Commode, and make the Company gueſs what it coſt, and where ſhe bought it? How hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py am I who have been never tempted to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice my health by much ſpeaking, and to dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fen the Aſſembly. I had rather go into a Cloi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, than to be troubleſom as theſe everlaſting Praters are, <hi>Dorince, Arcione, Bellamire, Arma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia,</hi> and <hi>Cleonne:</hi> You know they give the head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ach from morning till night to thoſe who have
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:60459:37"/>
the miſhap to meet with them in Company. Where do they gather up all this traſh? For a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us, they are no more knowing than an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite of women who talk leſs. Should one for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid them to ſpeak of their Accoutrements; you reduce them to a profound ſilence. As to my ſelf, were I minded to entertain you of theſe things, I would deſire you to take notice of the Gown I have now on, which I may ſay, without vanity, is the fineſt in <hi>Paris.</hi> Pray obſerve it, view it well; The more you obſerve it, the bet-you'll like it. It was gazed at with admiration yeſterday at the Princeſs's; the Dutcheſs of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarine</hi> took Coach immediately to buy the reſt of the Piece, and the Marchioneſs of <hi>Carnarvan</hi> was greatly afflicted 'twas all gone. I'le not tell you it coſt me a Farthing more or leſs than it really did; I leave theſe Fooleries to <hi>Partheniſſa,</hi> and <hi>Melinta.</hi> Is it not ſtrange women ſhould be ſo vain in theſe occaſions; for my part I will not ſay this Stuff coſt me ſo dear as <hi>Berenice</hi> would ſay it coſt her; This woman is ſtrangely extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant in theſe matters. Does ſhe think to draw more eſteem, by having it imagined, that her Petticoat coſt more than anothers? Has ſhe not reaſon to apprehend on the contrary, that ſhe will paſs for a Fool, in giving more for things than their value? Neither would I have you, Madam, to imagine that I am about to tell you my Gown ſtood me in leſs than it was worth; No, no, I pretend not to ſet up for a great houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wife, thereby to get an Husband. I have one already that I would be loth to part with. You cannot imagine how complaiſant he is to me, he brings me home ever and anon a thouſand knick-knacks;
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:60459:37"/>
There can be no Opera, but I muſt be at it; and the ſame it is for walks; and I do not remember that for two years We have been together, that he once ſpake of my Conduct, but to approve it. It is true, I give him no cauſe; I never bring home any of thoſe Gallants, or Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gabond Sparks, that walk from Street to Street, caſting up their Foppiſh Countenances at every Window, and now and then ſtep and ſtrut, like a Crow in a gutter who never want fine ſayings for all Complexions. Perhaps it may be judg'd I am not handſom enough to attract them; but I ſee on the contrary every day a thouſand home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Pugs, who have no more charms than I, and yet are continually ſurrounded with crouds of I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolizers. I dare ſcarce add, what I was told yeſterday at the Princeſs <hi>Demarata</hi>'s, whom I lately mentioned to you. However I was almoſt as much out of order then as I am now, and you know with what diſadventage a woman is look'd upon then. Yet a certain Spark would needs per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade me I was the fineſt woman.</p>
                        <p>I thought I had now a good opportunity of ſpeaking, imagining <hi>Arpaliſe</hi> would not refuſe to hear me in the occaſion ſhe offered me of prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing her. Yet ſhe interrupted me at the firſt word I began to ſpeak, and continued on talking till night, with that rapidity, that I had not ſo much as time to thank her for her viſit. At length I had a deliverance, but I heard her tongue run all the way ſhe went down Stairs, asking my Servants queſtions, and anſwering them her ſelf, and I cannot tell but ſhe may be yet talking whilſt I am relating this to you.</p>

                        <p>Before we end it, I would declare the Inſtruction which a certain Lady not far, has made me draw hence, which is, that to be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver accuſed of ſpeaking much, one ſhould ſpeak as ſhe does; and one had need only to ſee her often, to accuſtom ones ſelf to ſpeak little, through the pleaſure a body may have in heark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to her.</p>

                        <p>It is your ſelf, Madam, who now ſpeak too much, and you are now about being recompenſed for your Flattery. The Lady per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps whom you would have us to underſtand, will be far from applying it to her ſelf; and to puniſh you again in another ſort, I believe ſhe will make you but very ill Chear.</p>
                        <p>At theſe Words the Company aroſe, <hi>Dorante</hi> gave his Hand to <hi>Beliſe, Philemon</hi> to <hi>Cleonice,</hi> and <hi>Liſidor</hi> his to the young <hi>Lindamire.</hi> They
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:60459:40"/>
withdrew into a little Parlor, where they waſh'd without Ceremony, and after the ſame manner ſat down at Table. Although this was only a Treat for Friends, yet every thing was proper and neat: Scarce had they dined, when they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned into <hi>Cleonice</hi>'s Chamber, where they ſat down, and talk'd only of indifferent things, till <hi>Eraſtus</hi> began to ſpeak to enliven the Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

So long a Voyage does not ſeem to me abſolutely neceſſary, for the reaſſuming of the Diſcourſe we left off. I need only tell you, that among the Defects of great Talkers, we have not, I think, made any mention of Lying, which yet is the Vice wherewith ſuch Perſons are commonly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached.</p>

And here a reſemblance to truth is required; and a relation that wants it, would not draw much attention. So when a Man has a deſign to pleaſe by his diſcourſe, he ſhould mix, methinks, a Character of ſincerity to the agreableneſs of his expreſſions and behaviour. It is hereby that a diſcourſe pleaſes and inſinuates it ſelf; on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, we hear with uneaſineſs (as I ſaid before) what we do not believe.</p>

                        <p>I confeſs they are more capable of diſſembling than your groſs dull people; and therefore it is we ſee leſs ſincerity at Court than in the Country; and we ſee a ſubtiliz'd ſort of People in a Neighbouring State whoſe words are not greatly relyed on. However, it is not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to make the diſtinction you ſpeak of, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided a Man has a piercing and diſcerning judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. A man that would appear ſincere, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being ſo in effect, does oftentimes diſcover himſelf, even by the care he takes to conceal him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. He forgets nothing to attain his ends, but it is not ſo hard as you imagine to perceive cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain efforts he makes to perſwade. The earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which he ſhews, and the turn which he gives to his expreſſions are obſervable. Frankneſs guides it ſelf in a direct contrary manner, it tends plainly where it would go: It has a more open Air, appears in the eyes, in the geſture, and all the countenance. In ſtead of having recourſe to Ornaments of Language, it rejects them as fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, it is an enemy of oſtentation, and neglects the appearing wholly and fully what it is. It ſpeaks without Art, and with Confidence, and yet never fails of making a ſoft impreſſion. Whereas ſcarce have we perceived the artifices of a diſſembling Perſon; but ſo far are we from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing pleaſed in hearing him, that we are at a defiance with him, as imagining he is always ready to deceive us. An ingenious carriage pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces different effects, agreably inſinuates it ſelf, and according to the intentions it may have, it ſets our hearts at reſt, or moves our affections.</p>

a ſudden to <hi>Timante,</hi> I wonder, ſaid he to him, you ſhould reckon <hi>Melicerte</hi> homely; I find you but a bad Judge of Beauty, and I'll never truſt you in theſe matters again.</p>
                        <p>Conſider, I pray you, into what Confuſion this Simplicity caſt us. <hi>Timante</hi> did what he could to repair the Fault he had committed in ſpeaking, without doubt, too freely to a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of <hi>Merigenes</hi>'s Humour. Remember more punctually my words, anſwered he; I told you that <hi>Melicerte</hi> was a very amiable Perſon, and yet the Charms of her Face were not wholly comparable to the excellency of her Humour. Acknowledge, <hi>Timante,</hi> (replied <hi>Melicerte,</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to ſmile) That you are leſs ſincere now, than you was when you ſpake of me be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and yield that <hi>Merigenes</hi> is incomparably more than you. It is true, Madam (replied imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately the honeſt Man) you do me Juſtice; I proteſt I always ſpeak what I think is the Truth.

Modern <hi>Miſiſtra</hi> does but imperfectly repreſent. <hi>Merigenes</hi> was raviſh'd at the great ſucceſs we mention'd; and in the tranſports, which made him lift up his eyes to Heaven, he interrupted us to tell us, he could not believe the Country of the <hi>Moors</hi> was ſo good as we made it.

Yet I cannot imagine it is comparable to <hi>Pont-Euxin,</hi> for it is not above four or five years that I hear talk of that of <hi>Eſſek,</hi> but I have heard all my life time, admirable relations of the other.

                        <p>What you ſay brings to my remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance an adventure, which diverted the other day a great company at the Princeſs <hi>Demerata</hi>'s; they ſeem'd to be aſtoniſh'd there ſhould be ſuch a ſtrict tye of friendſhip between <hi>Celanire,</hi> to whom one may give thirty years, without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing too liberal; and <hi>Dorinice,</hi> who has never yet ſeen eighteen. However there was no doubt made but each might find his reckoning in this So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety; it was ſaid that <hi>Celanire,</hi> being leſs virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous than ſhe appeared to be, found no diſreliſh in ſharing in the voluptuouſneſs of a young per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, whom Lovers and Pleaſures every where at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended. That <hi>Dorinice</hi> on her ſide might receive good advice from an experienc'd friend; and even that ſhe might vail her wanton Air under the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended modeſty of <hi>Celanire.</hi> Scarce were theſe words ended when <hi>Celanire</hi> entred, and a while after was told, that they had been juſt talking of the friendſhip ſhe had for <hi>Dorinice.</hi> I am not the only perſon that loves her, replied ſhe; it muſt be allow'd ſhe appears very amiable, when one does not throughly examine her. It may be truly ſaid ſhe has a delicate Complexion, and
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:60459:45"/>
fire in her eyes; but I think ſhe ſeems too affected in her carriage, and too greedy of applauſe. I love her ſincerely, I wiſh ſhe would lay aſide thoſe little humours, and endeavour as much to get reputation as new admirers; I would not be thought to admire her defects; for we had like to have broke off for the Gown ſhe has worn for theſe four days. The Stuff is ſo rich, and ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable, that every one will judge that <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi> bought it. I was not wanting in adverti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing <hi>Dorinice</hi> of it; I told her what was whiſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed abroad of it, and that this report might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come more publick, and probably it might be added, that a Woman who accepts of preſents, will grant favours. <hi>Dorinice</hi> appeared to me ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed; and anſwer'd me, that <hi>Timocrates</hi> was not ſo well at eaſe as was imagin'd, and that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of making preſents, he was ſcarce able to ſatisfie his Creditors; that ſhe had much ado to get an hundred Guineys of him which ſhe had won at Baſſet, even before this play was forbid; that, in ſhort, ſhe was forc'd to make him take up this Stuff on credit to pay her. That, as to the reſt, ſhe never made it her ſtudy to ſhut peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples mouths. That ſhe knew very well Calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſpared no body; and that to have ones mind at reſt, it was ſufficient that one had nothing to reproach's one's ſelf withal. I made ſhew as if I believed what ſhe ſaid, and I replied coldly to her; That I wiſh'd the World was convinc'd of the truth of what ſhe now told me. And thus did <hi>Celanire</hi> teſtifie the ſincere reſpects ſhe had for <hi>Dorinice;</hi> and as if it had been a decree of Fate that we ſhould ſee the end of the Comedy; <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanire</hi> was no ſooner gone from <hi>Demarata</hi>'s, but
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:60459:46"/>
                           <hi>Dorinice</hi> entred, ſet forth in the, magnificient Gown ſo much diſcours'd of. Every body ſet forth the richneſs of the Stuff, ſome praiſed it ſincerely, others added roguiſhly, that what they liked it beſt for, was, that <hi>Dorinice</hi> had not put her hand in her Purſe for it. At leaſt, purſued <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rilas,</hi> if we may believe what <hi>Celanire</hi> now told us. I know not (replied <hi>Dorinice</hi> colouring) what ſhe may be pleas'd to ſay; but I ſuppoſe ſhe has ſaid no harm of me. But if any ſpark of Envy has induced her to pour venom in her relations, I could utter ſuch Truths as would not be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry advantageous to her. <hi>Dorilas,</hi> whoſe humour you know would not let paſs this occaſion of diverting us, and pretending to be in the intereſts of <hi>Dorinice,</hi> whom he thought fit to edge on; I know not (ſaid he with a feigned ingenuity) whether <hi>Celanire</hi> has a good way of ſetting off her Friends; however, I muſt ſay, ſhe has no good way of covering their defects. Why ſhould ſhe come with her circumſtances, the relations of which we never call'd for; what are we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd with her <hi>Timocrates,</hi> that ſhe ſhould bring him into a relation, when the diſcourſe was on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly about a Gown or Petticoat. I would willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly know (replied <hi>Dorinice</hi> all in an heat) what ſhe could ſay of <hi>Timocrates,</hi> and whether ſhe has had the malice to empoyſon— You are to blame in complaining (ſaid <hi>Dorilas,</hi> interrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her coldly) ſhe has only fairly related the opinions which the World has, when a Man buys a rich piece of Stuff, which is afterwards obſerv'd to be carried to a fair Lady; and after all, who can ſay, that <hi>Celanire</hi> will ſpeak of it any where elſe? What ſhe has ſaid here ſignifies
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:60459:46"/>
nothing; here was not in this room above four or five Men, and ſeven or eight Women. We could not forbear laughing at this pleaſant paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, which <hi>Dorinice</hi> obſerving, ſhe appear'd mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved with it, and was ready to fly upon <hi>Dorilas.</hi> However ſhe bethought her ſelf not to diſoblige any body, in a company which ſhe was glad to make favourable to her; and, diſſembling her reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſhe diſcovered only her paſſion againſt <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanire.</hi> I cannot comprehend, ſaid ſhe, how this Woman could have the imprudence to ſpeak a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me. Certainly ſhe muſt be Miſtreſs of a great ſtock of Calumny, and very fertile inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Beſides, ſhe ſhould never have uſed theſe to offend a Perſon who has long ſince learn'd to hold her tongue, but who can now break ſilence in a terrible manner for her. However, Madam, replied <hi>Dorilas,</hi> whatever ſhe ſaid, ſhe ſpake with an aſſured tone, and I am much miſtaken if you can diſmay her. Is it that ſhe is perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, replied <hi>Dorinice,</hi> that her Knight is redoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able enough to ſtop the mouths of the World? I would adviſe her to have leſs preſumption, if it be only this which renders her ſo bold. I am no more afraid of <hi>Timante</hi> than <hi>Celanire,</hi> and I have an hundred times told them both, that I was aſham'd of their conduct. It's well known that <hi>Timante</hi> has not above two hundred pound a year to live on, and yet keeps his fine Coach, and three Lacqueys. It's true he is young, and well ſhaped, and is never from <hi>Celanire,</hi> whoſe old Husband has immenſe riches. I ſuppoſe one may draw from theſe particularities, ſuch conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces as will not be much to <hi>Celanire</hi>'s advantage: but inſtead of ſtopping at conjectures, I can find
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:60459:47"/>
effects which will not tend to the juſtifying of her conduct. It's not three months ſince ſhe gave money to a Perſon of Quality who went into <hi>Flanders,</hi> and entreated him to buy her ſome of that Countries Horſes. The Comiſſion was exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted, the Horſes came, but not into <hi>Celanire</hi>'s Stable. They draw every day <hi>Timante</hi> in his vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſits to Court and other Walks. The Coach they draw is a very fine one, and the Maſter of it knows no more than I, what it coſt. After this, ſhall a Woman ſo liberal as ſhe find fault with <hi>Timocrates</hi>'s paying me what he owes me?</p>

My Eyes are ſmall, round, and melancholick; they ſpeak nothing, and my Mouth ſays as little. It has made a perpetual Divorce with Smiles and Pleaſanties. There is ſeen ſuch a Colour on my Skin, as will not diſpleaſe thoſe who love variety. My Shape is like Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> Bouvillon<hi>'s in the Comical Romance, and I
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:60459:48"/>
may ſay I am as well qualified for Converſation. I never diſpute, being no ways concerned in what is ſaid, and they would be to blame who ſhould complain that I interrupt People, ſeeing I always keep Silence. Curioſity which is natural to my Sex, has no Power over my Spirit: I know no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, I have learn'd nothing, and I have no mind to learn any thing.</hi>

The Qualities of his Soul anſwer thoſe of his Body, he is of a Chagrin Humour, reſtleſs and contrarying, nothing pleaſes him but what diſpleaſes others, and he finds no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing agreeable but what the world diſapproves: Envy and Hatred are his predominant Paſſions, he is never more out of Humour, than when he can do no Miſchief, and when he finds an occaſion to do it, he embraces it with joy. He has learn'd all ſorts of Languages, the better to deceive all ſorts of People; he imagines the Cheats which are made, denote a Superiority of Spirit with which he is charmed. Judge whether his Converſation be profitable and agreeable: He ſtutters, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not utter four words diſtinctly; the Difficulty
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:60459:49"/>
which he has in ſpeaking would make him avoid Company, did he not frequent it to provoke and diſturb it. Yet it's ſaid he is in Love; but if we believe him capable of being ſo, 'tis only to diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point a Rival, and give perpetual Trouble to a Miſtreſs.</hi>

                        <p>Expect not I ſhould enter on the particulars of what we may find praiſe-worthy in a perſon whom we would commend.</p>
                        <p>You know better than I, that one may reſpect the Gifts which he may have receiv'd from Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; as an elevated Soul, an upright Heart, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant and generous, a ſublime Spirit, vaſt and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrant; an happy Memory, a ſolid Judgement, and delicate Diſcernment.</p>
                        <p>As for the gifts of the Body, all the World immediately declares it ſelf for the Beauty of Women, and the good Meen of Men, and for my particular, I prefer Health and a noble and free Air in all manner of Behaviour.</p>
                        <p>We forget not the Favours which we hold of Fortune. It is ſhe which gives Riches and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours. And I dare even affirm ſhe often contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes to our Glory, in conducting us as it were by the Hand, into conjunctures, which become happy to us. But ſay we, in few Words, that true Merit conſiſts chiefly in the good uſe we make of the different advantages we now men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned.</p>
                        <p>I will follow the Cuſtom we have to refer this diſcuſſion to Morality, without charging our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation with it.</p>
                        <p>However I cannot but ſay ſomething of Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour and Liberty, which are my two favourite Virtues.</p>
                        <p>It is certain, that to be charm'd with 'em, I would have them be in all their purity, without

mixture. That Valour lead us to brave Actions, without proceeding to Raſhneſs; that it be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with a prudence which may make us fear the ill Succeſs which may be attributed to us; in a word, that it marches to glory through perils, without Oſtentation. I likewiſe require that it have no need of any aſſiſtance to render it ſelf worthy our admiration. That it be not ſuſtained either by Ambition, nor Anger, nor Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge. That in a Battel Emulation, Shouts, and Cries make it go neither farther nor with more earneſtneſs, than if it ſaw it ſelf alone and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>armed.

                           <hi>He practices himſelf alone all the Military Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, and it is an admirable thing, that being above all Corrivals, he contends for glory with himſelf; he endeavours to raviſh it from his firſt actions by others ſtill more glorious.</hi>

                        <p>As to what concerns Liberality, I would have it no leſs exempt from Oſtenation than Valour. I would have it readily ſhew'd, in a grateful man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and the moſt ſeemly as is poſſible, when it is to relieve perſons who want neceſſaries for their Subſiſtance. But I require, on the contrary, that one give in the ſight of as many People as is poſſible, when the gift is the recompence of Merit.</p>
                        <p>In a Word I would have a liberal Perſon to do as one of my Friends, did whoſe liberality is thus mention'd.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>His Liberality equals that of a magnificent Prince in the greatneſs of Preſents, and ſurpaſſes it in the choice of Perſons. Thoſe who receive his Benefits, are the only Perſons that can ſpeak of 'em. In fine, his generoſity would be more uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally admired, if it were not ſo great, becauſe more Perſons would comprehend it, in an Age wherein this Virtue is ſo rarely practis'd in it's perfection.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Loving as I do extreamly this beneficent hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, you would have me ſpeak more of it, and enlarge my ſelf a little on the bounty of a great King.</p>

Was ever ſeen in a mean fortune ſo much goodneſs as he ſhews in the midſt of his greatneſs? Whilſt all <hi>Europe</hi> lies proſtrate at his feet, imploring his protection, or redoubting his proweſs; it ſeems as if he had need of the leaſt of his Subjects; ſo ſenſible is he of their afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ſo earneſt is he to offer 'em remedies, ſo favourable an ear does he lend to their ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations.</p>

                        <p>
                           <hi>You know, Madam, that ordinary Beauties goe only to the Painters to ſeek ſome new Charms, or to get rid of ſome Defects.

putting him almoſt out of Countenance. But in fine, being aſhamed of his Confuſion, he took Courage, and with an aſſured Tone thus ſpake: Is it any marvel, ſays he, that I ſhould love a moſt amiable Lady? Shew me any Snow whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or any Roſe of a more lovely Colour than her Complexion? <hi>Berenice</hi>'s Eyes are black, great, well ſet, and temper'd with ſuch Sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and yet ſo ſparkling, that the Room ſhe ſits in ſeems to be on fire with 'em.

                        <p>I added immediately, that nothing could be truer than what <hi>Timagenes</hi> had ſaid of <hi>Beliſe.</hi> Of <hi>Beliſe,</hi> ſaid he briskly, the reſemblance of the names deceive you, it is of <hi>Berenice</hi> that I ſpeak.

                        <p>I ſhall never hear any diſcourſe of Praiſing, but I ſhall remember an Elogium which a Friend of <hi>Dorante's</hi> made for the King. Two Shepherds ſpake therein, one an <hi>Italian,</hi> whom I ſhall call <hi>Thirſis;</hi> the other a <hi>German,</hi> to whom I ſhall give the Name of <hi>Menalca.</hi> Their Character was as different as the Genius of their Nation. <hi>Thirſis</hi> loved ingenious Arts and Reſt.
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:60459:54"/>
                           <hi>Menalca</hi>'s inclinations lay only for War; and his greateſt delight was in a tumultuous Life. They came to <hi>France</hi> only to ſee a King who fill'd all the Earth with his Name. After they had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered him with great admiration, they looked on one another, and immediately knowing one another to be ſtrangers, they accoſted, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired the occaſion of their Travels. They had no ſooner underſtood it, but this conformity of deſign made 'em continue their Converſation: But I know not whether I ſhould make them to relate in wretched Proſe, what they moſt inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuouſly expreſs'd in Verſe.</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>Dorante.</speaker>
                        <p>Your Proſe is well worth my Friend's Poetry; only go on.</p>

                        <speaker>Cleonice.</speaker>
                        <p>I will tell you then in few words; that <hi>Thirſis</hi> was aſtoniſh'd how the King could ſo eaſily govern a great Kingdom, as a Father of a Family rules his Houſe. He admired the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom ſhould be ſo flouriſhing, and in ſo good or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, even as <hi>Menalca</hi> admired the Diſcipline ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd in the Armies. When the <hi>Italian</hi> acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd that <hi>Paris</hi> exceeded <hi>Rome</hi> for fine Arts and Painting, Buildings and Muſick; the <hi>German</hi> was charm'd to ſee with what exactneſs all that reſpected the Military Art was obſerved. He ſaid there were never any braver Troops, never any better pickt Men, better clad, better arm'd, and more willing to ſerve. If <hi>Thirſis</hi> muſed at Court on a King extraordinary well ſhaped, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitable, Magnificient, Wiſe, Merciful; <hi>Menalca</hi> could not be tired in Praiſing the Armies of a Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilant Prince, Indefatigable and Intrepid. In fine, not to engage my ſelf farther into a diſcourſe, whence I cannot, perhaps, eaſily extricate my
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:60459:54"/>
ſelf, I ſhall content my ſelf in telling you, that the two Shepherds obſtinately diſputed; that they could not agree, and that in their conteſt, they publiſh'd all the King's Virtues both Civil and Military.</p>

                        <p>It is then the Elogium of a Victorious Prince which I undertake, with the aſſiſtance of a deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate Wit, whoſe Works to my great misfortue you too well know, to thank me for what I recite out of 'em.</p>
                        <p>This Author writes to the Prince after the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of a conſiderable Battel, and makes him cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain reproaches, and forms a kind of Quarrel, in a manner, infinitely more agreeable than the moſt regular Congratulation. You may judge by ſeveral paſſages which I remember.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Hew joyful I am, my Lord, to be at a diſtance from your Highneſs, that I may the better ſay what I have long ſince thought of you. I dared not declare it, leſt I ſhould fall into the inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encies, wherein I have beheld Perſons who had taken the like Liberties. But, my Lord, you do too much to be paſt over in ſilence, and you will be unjuſt, if performing the Actions you do, it remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed there, and no mention were made to you of 'em. If you knew in what manner all the World talks of you, you would be aſtoniſh'd to ſee with how lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle fear of diſpleaſing you they ſpeak of what you have done. In truth, my Lord, I know not what you have thought of, for it was a great boldneſs
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:60459:55"/>
in you to have at your Age topt two or three old Captains, whom you ought to reſpect, if it were only for their Age. To have taken ſixteen pieces of Cannon which belonged to a Prince who is the King's Uncle, and the Queen's Brother, with whom too you never had any difference. To have put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to diſorder the beſt</hi> Spaniſh <hi>Troops who ſo kindly let you paſs. All this is contrary to good man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and matter enough, I think, for your Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor. I have heard indeed that you were obſtinate, and that it was not good contending with you, but I did not think you would have been tranſported ſo far, and if you continue, you will render your ſelf inſupportable to all</hi> Europe. <hi>Neither the Emperour nor King of</hi> Spain <hi>will have any thing to do with you.</hi>

Day 1400 <hi>Lewis</hi>'s at the deceaſed Monſieurs, where he had the Office of introducer of Embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors. Being an Honeſt Man as well as a Man of Wit, he would ſend away the next morning the Sum he had loſt; and finding at home only 1200 <hi>Lewis</hi>'s, he ſent to demand 200 of <hi>Coſtar</hi> his intimate Friend. Send them to me ſpedily, wrote he to him, you know I play no leſs on your credit than mine own. If you have them not, borrow 'em: If you find no hody that will lend 'em you, ſell all that you have, even to your good Friend Monſieur <hi>Pauquet.</hi> For I muſt not fail of having 200 <hi>Piſtols.</hi> You ſee with what imperiouſneſs my Friendſhip ſpeaks, the reaſon is becauſe it is vehement. Yours would ſay, I entreat you to lend me 200 <hi>Lewis</hi>'s, if you can, without putting your ſelf to any inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; I beg your pardon that I ſhould be ſo free with you.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Coſtar</hi> ſent the 200 Piſtols, and anſwered, he never believed he could have ſo much pleaſure for ſo little Money. Seeing you play on my credit, ſays he, I will always keep a ſtock to preſerve it. I can moreover aſſure you that a near Kinſman of mine has always a 1000 <hi>Lewis</hi>'s as much at my dipoſal as if they were in your Coffer. However I would not here by expoſe you to any conſiderable loſs. One of my neighbours told one yeſterday, that his loſt <hi>Pecunia</hi> would have proved the beſt Friend in the World to him, could he have kept him by him, and I adviſe you to keep yours. I ſend you back your Note, but am ſurpriſed you ſhould deal thus with me, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving taken ſuch a different courſe with Monſieur <hi>Balſac.</hi>

                        <p>The Company was very well ſatisfied with this Recital, and could not but entertain themſelves with it all the Supper time.</p>

I think that to ſpeak with a due Decorum, is to utter only things preciſely which are ſuitable to times, pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and perſons; ſuch as are fit for him that ſpeaks, and thoſe who hear.</p>

                        <p>I acknowledge it's hard to judge of the diſpoſition wherein the Perſons are that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe an aſſembly. The greateſt part of Mankind makes it a kind of Merit to be always on its Guard, and to conceal its intentions. Beſides, Mens Humours change; Health is not always the ſame; Ambition, Love, and different Intereſts in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire different Inclinations. But, Madam, it is not neceſſary that our knowledge ſhould reach to the Hearts of Perſons, and that we ſound into the depths of their Souls, whether they be ſuch in effect as they appear to be. It is ſufficient we know what their rank is, that we may have the deference for 'em that is due; and that we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:60459:57"/>
what their capacity is; that we may not ſpeak too boldly before abler Folks than our ſelves. It's true, that theſe reflections are not ſufficient, we are obliged to remember our ſelves. What would you think, if a little young Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, tho' born in <hi>Wales,</hi> ſhould draw his Chair, and ſit jig by joul with a Duke or Marqueſs; or interrogate in a familiar tone with a Marſhal of <hi>France?</hi>

I ſay there are things which are truly ingenious, and yet which loſe their reliſh in the Mouth of a Man that is not of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion. You have perhaps heard of a neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Prince entertaining one day his chief Miniſter, on the moſt ſubtile parts of Natural Philoſophy: His Favourite heard him with im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience, and being deſirous his Maſter would rather apply himſelf to the Study of the Art of Reigning, than Phyſical Queſtions. <hi>Sir,</hi> (ſaid he to him, in interrupting him diſcontentedly) <hi>are you not aſhamed to be ſo well verſt in theſe matters?</hi>

                        <p>There are People whom another ſort of Vanity blinds. You knew <hi>Clitandre,</hi> he was the Son of a mean Citizen, and an Office which he held under the King, was not more conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable than his Extraction. Yet he was well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough received by Perſons of the greateſt Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and it was his Converſation that procur'd him this admittance. I may likeways ſay, that he
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:60459:58"/>
would have extreamly pleas'd, had he but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred what he was: But he ſhew'd more Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity than Wit in his diſcourſes and behaviour. One day being at a Princeſſes, where there were none but Perſons of great Rank, he addreſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to ſome old Lords, who were Governours of Provinces, or the King's Lieutenants of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, and talk'd to them of <hi>Verſailes,</hi> as one would ſpeak of <hi>Japan</hi> to Perſons that had never ſeen the Map. You cannot believe, ſaid he to them, how great the Charms are which fix us to the Court, maugre the fatigues and perils we may meet there. I profeſs our Life is a real Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigation, that we are toſt about, behold every Day wracks, and are uncertain whether the Waves will drive us into Port, or run us on a Rock. Judge in what aſtoniſhment was the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany. They look'd on one another, they ſmiled, and fail'd not to demand of <hi>Clitandre</hi> news from <hi>Verſailes,</hi> with as much earneſtneſs, as when our Ambaſſador arriv'd from <hi>Siam.</hi> In fine, his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption ſo blinded him, that the Company grew weary of hearing him, and bearing with him any longer.</p>

Some four Months paſt I found her more melancholy than ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and I ask'd her the reaſon.

In ſtopping to let them go in or out, in directing our words to them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the reſt of the Company, in ſhewing Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaiſance for their Sentiments, or at leaſtwiſe in not directly oppoſing them, if they prove contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to ours?</p>

                        <p>You have, perhaps, heard a ſtory of a Man of this ſtamp, who was more covetous than <hi>Plauto</hi>'s <hi>Euclio.</hi> It is ſaid that he had a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious heap of Corn, whence he pretended to draw a moſt conſiderable Profit; when of a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den the Rain which was much wanted came and deſtroyed his Hopes. He would needs live no longer after this misfortune; he fitted a Rope to his Neck, and faſtned it to a Beam of his Chamber, and throwing himſelf in a Fury off the Chair he ſtood on, by miſhap he threw that down, which made ſuch a Noiſe, that the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple underneath came running up and beheld this Spectacle, and a Neighbour cut the Rope, to ſave, if poſſible, this Wretches Life. In fine, he was ſo carefully plied with proper Remedies, that his Life was recovered againſt his Will. Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours were alſo uſed to compoſe his Mind, and a certain Almanack was produced that promiſed ſuch Storms of Hail as would deſtroy all the Corn in the Fields. But he fell again into diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet, when he was told in what manner he was preſerv'd. Nothing would ſerve his turn but that his Rope ſhould be paid for, and knowing that his Neighbour laugh'd at his Folly, he got a Warrant for him to bring him before a Juſtice to ſatisfie for the Damage he did him in cutting his Rope.</p>

                        <p>I have a Kinſman who has not hang'd himſelf yet, although his Covetouſneſs is no wiſe inferiour to your Uſurer's. My Kinſman is young, he has Birth, and Courage; and yet a baſe Humour blemiſhes whatever otherwiſe is praiſe worthy in him: I perſwaded him to ſerve in the Wars, and the better to prevail with him, I ſet before him, that if he lived, he would be
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:60459:63"/>
recompenſed; and that if he hapned to die, he would find— You believe, perhaps, I told him that he would find Honour; not at all, but that he would find an end of his Expences, which a Man is obliged to make during the courſe of his Life. Our Miſer reſolved upon it; but when he was to buy Horſes, and provide the reſt of his Equipage, he ſoon renounced War; he told me he had rather retire to an Eſtate he had near <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi> and that he could ſubſiſt on a hundred things, whence Farmers draw a Profit, which he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended not to let them have. To turn him from this Deſign, I offered to make a Campaign with him at Sea, if he were willing to go; and he needed no Horſes nor Tents for this; and the Captains Table being at his Service, he conſented thereto, and we ſet out. It's not neceſſary to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late to you what our Naval Army did, I ſhall only tell you, that at our Return, we found our ſelves at <hi>Provence</hi> in the beginning of Winter. We would needs enjoy the fine time of that Countrey, and therefore made a Match of walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out with Ladies. One day as we walk'd in a Path, ſeparated from a Meadow by a Ditch; we thought that this Separation was not great enough to hinder us from leaping to the other ſide, and enjoying a nearer Converſation with the Ladies. Our Miſer, being accuſtomed to ſparing, was ſo ſparing of his Strength, that he leap'd into the Ditch. The Ladies burſt out into a Fit of Laughter, and I made what haſte I could to aſſiſt my Kinſman. I ſtooped as low as I could to draw him out thence, bidding him only give me his Hand: This Word affrighted him more than his Fall; and looking earneſtly upon me,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:60459:64"/>
What would you, anſwered he immediately, have me to give you? At theſe words I obſerv'd the Fault I had committed, and explaining my ſelf in a manner more conformable to his Inclination; Couſin, replied I, ſhall I give you my Hand? With all my Heart, anſwered he, dear Couſin; and having offered his, I drew him out of the Ditch, where I believe he would have ſtill lain, had I not chang'd the Expreſſion.</p>

                        <p>I know a Woman who has a great deal of Wit, and talks well when there is no menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Sickneſs or Remedies. But ſhe gives very good diverſion, as ſoon as the Converſation turns on matters relating to Health. I was ſaying ſomething to her yeſterday about her Husband, who is a very honeſt Gentleman, and after ſhe had allowed his good qualities, ſhe aded, that he had one bad one, which ſhe could not cure him of; which is, ſays ſhe, that he is ſo obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, that he will take no Remedies? But why ſhould he take any, replied I, if he be well? How, ſaid ſhe, do you think it enough to be in Health, without taking Remedies for preventing Diſtempers which you may fear?</p>
                        <p>In fine, when this imaginary ſick Body takes Medicines, ſhe taſtes it then, and ſays there is too much <hi>Sena</hi> in one, too much <hi>Rhubarb</hi> in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other;
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:60459:64"/>
juſt as we find fault with Broths being too hot or too cold. Her Phyſician in ordinary died not long ago, and her Friends fixt another on her of a Humour ſo frank and brisk, that inſtead of preſcribing Remedies to her, he did her the Diſpleaſure to tell her, that ſhe was in good Health. She fell into a Paſſion, and anſwered ſmartly to this honeſt Doctor, That if he would order her nothing, ſhe knew where to find out others that would. The next morning ſhe choſe one, who Regales her every morning with diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Medicines to her Content. It's not above three or four days ago that I was at her Houſe, and diverted my ſelf with hearing her talk of the ſeveral ſort of Diſeaſes ſhe fear'd, and their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Remedies. Her Friends do never fail to ſend to know of her Health; and a Lacquey of <hi>Amaſia</hi>'s being come on the ſame Errand, You may tell your Lady, anſwered ſhe, with a lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing Air, that I thank her for her mindfulneſs of me, but that my Health is loſt, there falling a cold humour on my left ſhoulder which puts me to grievous pain. This Lacquey was no ſooner gone, but we ſaw the Princeſs <hi>Demarata</hi>'s Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man enter; he made ſuch another ſort of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliment, but he had a different anſwer made him. I pray you, Sir, ſaid our fanciful Lady, to let the Princeſs know how ſenſibly I find my ſelf obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to her, tell her that a grievous pain in my head has hindred me ever ſince yeſterday from taking any reſt. As ſoon as ever this Gentleman was gone, I look'd on the pretended ſick body with amazement. Is your diſtemper gotten up into your head within this minute, ſaid I to her briskly, or have you forgot that it is not a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

Have you not a thouſand times obſerved the continual perplexity of one of theſe Wantons, how to dreſs her ſelf, and to keep all ſhe thinks ſhe has acquired? She ſpeaks to one, looks on the ſecond, and ſmiles on the third. This Theam is ſo large, that it is ſufficient to deter a Man that has talk'd enough already. I dare no more inſiſt on the Railleries which one might make of jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Perſons. I ſhall content my ſelf in telling you, that theſe laſt Fools are yet more ridiculous than others. They never fail to form imaginary Subject of their frenzy, when they cannot find a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny real.

If you will, we will ſay likewiſe, that indirect Raille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries do pleaſe no leſs in an Entertainment, than praiſes which are given indirectly, have a grace in a Panegyrick.</p>
                        <p>Here's a Tour which will not diſpleaſe you, it alone makes an indirect Raillery ſo much the more delicate, as it appears ſimple, natural, without affectation, and without malignity.</p>
                        <p>A certain Perſon of <hi>Paris</hi> whom I ſhall call <hi>Liſicrates,</hi> had nothing but what was obſcure in his Birth and his Life. However, a Son he had, being gone into <hi>Italy</hi> very young, had got a great Eſtate at <hi>Rome,</hi> and ſent wherewithal to make Plenty reign in his Family. The Father died, and a Nephew to whom he had left a good Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſet up for a Spark. It came into one of my Friends Head to abaſe his Pride, and to ſhew him
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:60459:66"/>
that his Family was ſtill obſcure enough not to be known in his own Countrey. He found him in a Company where the Converſation turn'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on News. My Friend was ask'd what he knew, becauſe he was a Perſon of good Intelligence: He told them what was talk'd of at <hi>Varſailles,</hi> and paſſing afterwards to Foreign Countreys, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported with an Artificial Tone, <hi>That the Letters from</hi> Rome <hi>inform us, that</hi> Liſicrates <hi>is dead in this Town.</hi>

biting in their Railleries, and in their pretended witty words; but ſeeing we are on witty words, ſhall we do amiſs in examining wherein they dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer from Raillery?

They ſhould be cloſe, ſharp, and lively, and in ſome ſort like Epigrams.

from the Ancients, an infinite number of great Sayings, with which you may be ſatisfied. But very likely you have not been much delighted with the Language of <hi>Amiot,</hi> when you have read the Tracts of <hi>Plutarch,</hi> call'd, The <hi>Notable Sayings of Princes, Captains,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

Now for my part, I am for letting them paſs, and think my ſelf obliged in ſome ſort, to thoſe Perſons who endeavour to divert me, although they prove not always fortunate in their undertaking. But

I could never endure in Hiſtory, that great Men ſhould make uſe of an Equivocation to break their Word. Can we execuſe that Captain, who by a Truce grants, that no acts of Hoſtility ſhall be exercis'd for eight days, and immediately af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſhall ſend out Parties every night to ravage the Enemies Country?</p>

                        <p>He may take this for a Warlike Stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagem, yet all the World will condemn his breach of Faith. We may call things how we will, but that will not hinder us from being infamous, if we under pretence of a Treaty, ſurpriſe our Enemies. I much blame your Captain, but do more deteſt the cruel prefidiouſneſs of a <hi>Turk</hi> towards a <hi>Venetian.</hi> The latter of theſe ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred himſelf, and the Capitulation bore, That his Head ſhould be ſafe from all miſcheif. His Enemy had him no ſooner in his power, but he made him be ſawed aſunder in the midſt of his Body. In the exceſs of his pain, the Chriſtian invoked Heav'ns Vengeance againſt ſo cruel a trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery. And the Infidel anſwered him, with a malicious ſmile, that he had no reaſon to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain, ſeeing his Head was not touched.</p>

                        <p>Have you obſev'd one thing which I now remark? which is, That deſigning only to examine what may pleaſe in Converſation, we are gotten inſenſibly to Examples, wherein there are more Moral ſtroaks than Maxims which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect an Entertainment. May we not be told that we vary from our Subject, and that we ſhould retrench theſe digreſſions?</p>

<pb n="119" facs="tcp:60459:70"/>
requiring a Converſation dry, ſervile, and tire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom. But as to us who have a different relliſh, we will allow our ſelves this liberty; and when any Hiſtory or Tale may ſerve to recreate the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity of Precepts, or make us more exact and cautious, we will gladly entertain it. Thus be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing inſtructed, if we are to make a Truce for eight days, we will take ſuch meaſures as not to be deceived, we will expreſs that it ſhall be for eight natural days of twenty four hours, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the nights ſhall be comprehended. But inſtead of troubling our ſelves with juſtifying our citati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, it's enough to alledge that they pleaſe us; and if <hi>Philemon</hi> has any ſcruple hereupon, let him ſend it to ſome muſty Pedant, and let him be pleaſed with us as heretofore. I am ſo ſure that he will be ſo, that I will reaſſume the diſcourſe where it was broke off.</p>
                        <p>Here's an equivocal Word which heretofore ſurpriſed the whole World; or rather, here's a ſubtlety of extraordinary conſequence. You know, that of the <hi>Scipio</hi>'s there were two that bore the name of <hi>Affrican;</hi> that the firſt vanquiſh'd <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibal,</hi> and that the other deſtroyed <hi>Carthage.</hi> This laſt, the better to ſubdue Enemies who were ſo terrible to the <hi>Romans,</hi> made uſe of an Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation, or rather of a diſtinction which you will not find worthy of ſo great a Man. The <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> finding themſelves too weak to hold out long, offered to capitulate and ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their Town; and <hi>Scipio</hi> promis'd them there ſhould be no hurt done to their City. But ſcarce was he Maſter of it, but he cauſed the Fortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of it to be deſtroyed. The <hi>Carthaginians</hi> cried out, that the Faith of the Treaty was vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated:
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:60459:71"/>
But for all that, <hi>Scipio</hi> failed not to level their Walls and Towers.</p>
                        <p>He endeavoured afterwards to juſtifie himſelf, and ſhew that he had not broke his Word. He repreſented to the <hi>Carthanigians,</hi> that the <hi>Romans</hi> did not confound the names of Town, and City. That the Body of the Citizens formed the City, and that the Walls and other Edifices compoſed the Town. That he ſhould have been diſpleaſed had the Inhabitants been ill treated; but more diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed, had he left the Walls and Fortifications entire, which could be of no uſe, but only to raiſe a Jealouſie in the <hi>Roman</hi> People.</p>

                        <p>The <hi>Athenians,</hi> fearing to be beſieged, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected by the <hi>Perſians,</hi> conſulted the Oracle on the Revolutions they were to take. It was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, That the City muſt depart the Town, and ſave it ſelf by wooden Walls. So that it was interpreted, that the Citizens ſhould aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don a Town, which was not ſtrong enough to ſecure them; and that they ſhould get on board their Ships, to flie from the Danger wherewith they were threatned. There is no body in this Room, but has heard talk of <hi>Paris</hi> in this dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Senſe. When we mean the Town, we ſay that <hi>Paris</hi> is every day embeliſhed; and when we ſpeak of the Inhabitants, the Body of which makes what the Ancients called City; we ſay, That all <hi>Paris</hi> is walking in the Park; That all <hi>Paris</hi> is gone into the Countrey in the beginning of Autumn.</p>

                        <p>The other anſwer is of Count <hi>Maurice</hi> of <hi>Naſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſau.</hi> A Lady entreated him to tell her who was the firſt Captain of the Age? Count <hi>Maurice</hi> was unwilling to ſpeak his mind on ſo nice a point; his Modeſty did not permit him to name him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and his Merit would not permit him to part with an Honour, of which he was worthy; ſo that ſeeing himſelf ſtraitned, <hi>Madam,</hi> anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed he at length, <hi>The Marqueſs of</hi> Spinola <hi>is the Second.</hi>

                        <p>I'll tell you then, to ſatisfie you, that <hi>Themiſtus</hi> was carried into the company of a young Lady, whoſe ſight ſtruck him with great admiration. <hi>Celimene,</hi> let me ſo call her if you pleaſe, had but a very mean Fortune, with an extraordinary Beauty, ſo that <hi>Themiſtus,</hi> who had immenſe Riches, made ſerious reflections on this ſudden and violent engagement. He could take no reſt, He found himſelf in a perpetual agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and fear'd above all, leſt his paſſion, which he felt ſo violent in its beginning, would lead him in fine, to the ſatisfying his deſires, to the prejudice of his Fortune.</p>
                        <p>He reſolved to baniſh from his Soul ſo dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:60459:74"/>
a tenderneſs, he oppoſed it all he could; and finding he could not immediately overcome it, he called in a ſentiment of Glory to the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of his Reaſon. He had the ſtrength to part far from what he loved, and to go a Volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teer into the Army; but he returned thence more amorous than he went. He viſited his Miſtreſs with greater joy, and a ſtronger deſire; then blaming himſelf for his weakneſs, he made a ſecond effort, and undertook a ſecond Voyage, which was into <hi>Italy.</hi> He would try whether the divertiſements would appeaſe thoſe inquie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes which the perils and fatigues could not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay, but the <hi>Carnaval</hi> of <hi>Venice</hi> was as little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducive to that purpoſe, as the Siege of <hi>Buda.</hi> Our <hi>Themiſtus</hi> appear'd to me at his return more ardent and paſſionate than ever. My dear <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemon,</hi> ſaid he, I lead a wretched life, I cannot forget <hi>Celimene,</hi> I have her always in my thoughts and I ſee her continually before my eyes with all her Charms. <hi>In fine,</hi> added he, and this was his ſaying, <hi>In ſhort I muſt marry her, that I may ceaſe thus to love her.</hi> He married her in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, and fifteen days of Marriage changed his violent and tumultuous Love, into a ſweet and delightful Friendſhip.</p>

                        <p>You know that the illuſtrious Perſon who has given ſuch fine Converſations to the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, yet was more pleaſed in doing a good Office, than in making a fine Book; ſo that you will not be ſurpriſed, if ſhe uſed her moſt earneſt endeavours in begging an employ for a young Gentleman who had been recommended to her. The thing depended on a great Lord who was one of her Friends, and to whom ſhe ſaid a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand good things of the Perſon whoſe intereſts ſhe proſecuted. The great Lord examined the Perſon, he found him very fit, and that he want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not ſenſe; but he anſwered, he ſeemed to young for the buſineſs he was recommended. <hi>How, Sir,</hi> anſwered our generous Friend, <hi>will you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach him with a fault, which we every day cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect but too much againſt our wills?</hi>

                        <p>At the ſame inſtant as <hi>Dorante</hi> had ſaid this, Word was brought that all was ready; the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany immediately aroſe, and ſet out to go to the new Opera. They ſaw it with a great deal of ſatisfaction; but the application which <hi>Dorante</hi> had to it, hindred him not from examining more than once <hi>Liſidor</hi>'s Countenance.</p>
                        <p>He was deſirous to obſerve the effect which a ſplendid ſight might produce in the mind of a young Man who had never ſeen the like. <hi>Cleo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice</hi> conſulted <hi>Lindamire</hi>'s eyes for the ſame rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:60459:75"/>
and took notice that ſhe and <hi>Liſidor</hi> conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed one part of their ſurpriſe.

One of his Friends adviſed him to addreſs him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to ſome ingenious Man, and conſult him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he expoſed his Book to be criticis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>d by the Publick. This Country Author would by no means yield to this at firſt, thinking this advice fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs for a Poem which had been approved in his Country, but at length he permitted himſelf to be led to <hi>Chapelain,</hi> apparently to acquire eſteem for it, rather than to admit of corrections. He told him he came to ſhew him an Epic Poem he had made at home, and that he would gladly hear ſo great a Maſter's opinion on his Work. To ſpeak freely, anſwered <hi>Chapelain,</hi> you are to be commended for having undertaken ſo difficult a Work at your Age, and in a Country ſo far from all aſſiſtance, which one might have at <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris.</hi> Sir, replied the Author, I will dedicate this Poem to the Mareſchal <hi>d'Albret.</hi> You cannot make a better choice, replied the complaiſant <hi>Chapelain,</hi> the Mareſchal is a Man of Wit, and he is Governour of your Province. You will be near a <hi>Mecenas,</hi> who will relliſh your Writings, and give you his protection. After theſe words the Manuſcript was opened, and the young Wit read about 50 or 60 Verſes. This beginning was wide, and had no coherence with the Subject, ſo that <hi>Chapelain</hi> telling him, I ſee, Sir, you have thought fit to treat of things at firſt in general, to deſcend afterwards into particulars which more cloſely relates to your Subject. Ah! Sir, cried the young Man, what ſatisfaction there is in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:60459:77"/>
a Perſon like you, you know already the ſcope of my Poem, as well as if I had read it all to you.</p>
                        <p>No ſooner was this ſaid, but People came in, the Lecture broke off, and our Author went out. He was ſo well pleaſed with the Viſit he made, that turning himſelf towards him that had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced him, You muſt acknowledge, ſaid he to him briskly, that no firſt Book had ſo great ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs: I do not ſee how, anſwered his Friend, you can ſay that a Poem has ſucceeded before it comes abroad into the World; unleſs you do as the Marqueſs <hi>Moliere</hi> ſpeaks of, who lik'd the Play before the Candles were lighted. To ſpeak ſincerely, Monſieur <hi>Chapelain</hi> has too great In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence; and if you will be ruled by me, we will conſult ſome one that has leſs.</p>
                        <p>They went to the Abbot <hi>d' Aubignac,</hi> and after the accuſtomed Civilities were paſt, the Young Man told him that he had made an Epic Poem. So much the worſe, replied the Abbot briskly, for I am ſure you know not what an Epic Poem is, ſeeing that at your Age you ſet about a thing which the moſt conſummate Learned Men dare not undertake. This Boldneſs ſhews me better than your Accent from what Country you come. But, Sir, replied the Author, with Aſtoniſhment ſufficient, I compoſed this Work only to dedicate it to the Marſhal <hi>d' Albret.</hi> You could not worſe addreſs your ſelf, replied the Abbot. Do not you know that the Marſhal <hi>d' Albret</hi> is one of the fineſt Wits we have? That he loves to rally, and that he will laugh at you and your Poem? He being Governour of our Province—
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:60459:77"/>
For this very reaſon, replied impatiently the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot, you ought not to lay your ſelf open to him, and expoſe your ſelf to be the Laughing-ſtock of your Countrey. But, Sir, replied again the young Man, you ſpeak of Faults, without having ſeen any; hearken, if you pleaſe, and you may bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter judge afterwards: He took then immediately a Sheet, and read it, without allowing the Abbot ſo much time as to interrupt him. But before he came to the Sixth Verſe, the Abbot <hi>d' Aubignac</hi> being tired with hearing it, ſaid with ſome ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to him, I would gladly know, Sir, ſays he, whether this be the beginning of a Work of Piety, or of a Prophane Piece, of an Hiſtory or Fable? But, Sir, a little more Patience, till I— Pray tell me not of Patience, anſwered the Abbot, <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gil,</hi> who perhaps knew as well as you the Rules of an Epic Poem, ſays immediately that he ſings the great Actions of that Hero who came firſt from the <hi>Trojan</hi> Shores into <hi>Italy.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The young Author, being as it were Thunder-ſtruck, goes to <hi>Chapelain</hi> to comfort himſelf. Sir, ſaid he to him, I am lately come from the moſt intollerable Critick in the World, who is the Abbot <hi>d' Aubignac,</hi> who would not ſo much as ſuffer me to read ſeven or eight Verſes of my Work. He told me my Beginning was not worth a Straw, and that it had no Relation to the Subject. I believe, anſwered <hi>Chapelain,</hi> that Monſieur the Abbot <hi>d' Aubignac</hi> is not wholly in the wrong; but however, the Buſineſs is not paſt Remedy, you can make another Beginning, and keep that of your Poem for the firſt Work you ſhall make.</p>

I was told that the deceaſed Count <hi>de Fieſque,</hi> coming from the Play, met <hi>Chapelain,</hi> and told him he had been greatly diverted with the Sight of a Play he named him. Is it poſſible, Sir, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered him <hi>Chapelain,</hi> that ſo great a Man as you, and who has ſo great Wit, can behold with Pleaſure a Comedy wherein the Characters are not upheld, wherein the Actors come and ſpeak, without knowing why, nor how; and, in fine, wherein there's not the Obſervation of the leaſt Rule? The Count was for reviewing the ſame piece with a greater Application. He con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered better of it, and went afterwards to <hi>Chapelain,</hi> Pray, ſays he to him, reſtore me my Ignorance, I was greatly diverted with the Play before, but now I take no Delight in it.</p>

                        <p>I believe a Man ſhould be leſs haſty to anſwer, when his Advice is ask'd in Relation to Manners, and the ordering of ones Life. Beſides the Preſumption we ſhew, when we give over haſtily theſe kind of Advices, it ſeems as if we were ſure of the Event, and that we may be juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reſponſible, when the Succeſs anſwers not Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation. So that we muſt let others ſpeak, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially if they have more Experience than we, and let us not give in our Opinions before we are ask'd more than once. If we be oblig'd to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, let it not be too affirmatively, let us mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtly utter the Reaſons which uphold our Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and ſhew we not in our Countenances, nor Diſcourſes, an Air of Confidence, which may make us appear full of our ſelves. I know you are not of an Age to be conſulted, and there is little Likelyhood that old Men will need your Advice, but young Perſons may require it, and others too hereafter. Moreover I do not keep ſtrictly to the giving you preciſely the Precepts ſuitable to you; it will do you no Hurt to know others, to the end that minding the Perſons who obſerve them, you will come the better to know the World. I doubt not but you are ſatisfied with the Company you have ſeen, they are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarily well humour'd and ingenious. You
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:60459:79"/>
have taken notice how free they are, and remote from all conſtraint and affectation; you have ſeen nothing but what's eaſie, natural, and ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in what they ſay; it is this Air you muſt imitate, if you will pleaſe in Converſation.</p>

Your principal deſign is to pleaſe in the Converſation of the World, let's therefore ſee what may contribute to this Deſign.</p>
                        <p>It is a great advantage to have a gallant Air, but it is an advantage which a Man can acquire but imperfectly by his endeavours. Nature muſt begin it in us, and we muſt afterwars cultivate theſe favourable diſpoſitions. We may polliſh them, and perfect them by frequenting Perſons who have already this Air, if we imitate them in their Converſation, and manner of behaviour.</p>

                        <p>Is it not ſufficient to pleaſe in Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, that we are able by our good <hi>Meen</hi> to give weight and relliſh to our Words?</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>Dorante.</speaker>
                        <p>A good Meen alone does not always produce this good effect; we ſee every day Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try People, who are well ſhaped and of a good
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:60459:79"/>
aſpect, and yet are in no wiſe agreeable company. The Air I ſpeak of, is the Soul of a good <hi>Meen;</hi> without this Air, it is very difficult to pleaſe; it is this gallant and polite Air, which renders every thing pleaſing. It's ſeen on the Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, in a Diſcourſe, Cloaths, at Table, Houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold-ſtuff, Equipage, and even in Buildings. Moſt young People ſtrive to out do one another in Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantry, but they are leſs gallant than they think for. They do not moderate themſelves enough, and their heat makes 'em carry things too far. The air of Politeneſs we ſpeak of requires ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and young People have I know not what that is brisk, which does not agree with the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of a gallant Man. You have obſerv'd that they are commonly too haſty in taking up what is neweſt in Modes, and that they ſeldom fail of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing beyond the bounds which a gallant Man ſhould preſcribe. Inſtead of a well contriv'd ſuit, they are for laying on the heavyeſt Lace or Embroide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry they can get. If they give a Treat, they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to exceſs, and for their Equipage they are not contented with what's neat and fit, they add more Splendour than their Quality or Eſtate re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires. They think of nothing but diſtinguiſhing themſelves hereby, far from regulating their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence by their Revenue.</p>
                        <p>Neither muſt a Man; to-render himſelf agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in Converſation, utter only ſubtle things, or out of the common Road. It is not neceſſary to ſhew a great ſtock of Learning, and a vaſt deal of Wit. It is ſufficient to ſpeak with an eaſie air, and that nothing ſavours of affectation and conſtraint, as I have already recommended to you more than once. I was very glad that you ſaw
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:60459:80"/>
ſo ſoon <hi>Cleonice, Beliſe</hi> and <hi>Lindamire.</hi> The two firſt have a very ingenious manner, which may contribute to make you get the ſame air and the ſame tour. You will never part from them without profitting either in your Underſtanding or Will.</p>
                        <p>You will meet with few Women whoſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation is more agreeable; you may get by them ſuch an air, as the reading of the beſt Authors, nor the moſt learned Conferences will never af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford you. I likewiſe confeſs that I am not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed at your ſeeing of <hi>Lindamire;</hi> it is natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral for you to wiſh to pleaſe her, and it cannot be, having this deſign, but that you muſt endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to polliſh your mind, to make your humour ſweet and inſinuating, in a word, to acquire the qualities which may gain the eſteem of Ladies. Moreover, the deſire which one may have to touch the Heart of a fine Woman who has Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and Merit, may ſerve as a preſervative a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt a diſorder wherein Perſons of your Age do too often fall. Not that I pretend you ſhould bound your viſits to <hi>Cleonice,</hi> and that being ſo young you ſhould begin to ſigh in form for <hi>Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damire.</hi> When you have made two or three Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paigns, I will ask your ſentiments hereupon, and I will tell you mine. However, I muſt needs ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge to you, that I ſhould rather ſee you fixt on <hi>Lindamire,</hi> than any other Perſon I know; but however I would not have this reſpect for her proceed ſo far as to hinder you from ſeeing other companies, and to make thence your obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations of different humours. However I do not mean you ſhould go from Houſe to Houſe, to flatter and make Courtſhip to Ladies who will
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:60459:80"/>
not be diſpleaſed with it. A Man that makes this his buſineſs, will be ſo far from being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected as a gallant Perſon, that he will be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted no better than an idle Fop.</p>
                        <p>Now as to ſuch directions as concern young Men in general. Have you not obſerv'd they fall often into defects contrary to the manners of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lite Men? They laugh every moment ſo loudly, that their laughter is in no ſort like the ſubtle ſmiles obſervable in the Converſation of polite Perſons. They diſengage Friends to draw them into other Companies, and inſtead of living re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectfully with Women, they imagine it the beſt breeding to uſe 'em familiarly. That which I find ſtrangeſt, is, that they ſometimes proceed to ſwearing, like the raſcally mean People.</p>
                        <p>And yet it is not difficult to avoid theſe faults, and I wiſh you at no greater trouble in attaining the fine Air we ſpoke of. You have all the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions which can be deſired, and I hope you will cultivate them with ſucceſs.</p>

                        <p>There is much difference between a Man of great Air, and a Man that has the Air great; and I add, that we muſt no more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found a gallant Man, with a Man gallant. The firſt has this Air gallant, ſo much talk'd of in <hi>France,</hi> and which anſwers in ſome ſort to the Urbanity of the Ancient Romans; the other may without politeneſs be a Womans Gallant, or have an inclination to Gallantry in general. An old Man may pleaſe by the quality of Gallant Man,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:60459:81"/>
but he would be ridiculous if he made Gallantries in his old days.</p>

                        <p>I ſuppoſe that when we ſay that ſuch a Man has a good Air, we praiſe him leſs, than if we attribute to him the Air great, or the Air Gallant.</p>

                        <p>You need not doubt of it, and it is likewiſe certain, that the good Air agrees diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently to the two Sexes, to all ages, and all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions. A Sword Man, has commonly an open and fierce Air, a Magiſtrate is grave; a Woman ſhould have ſweetneſs and modeſty, but the Air great is the moſt rare; and ſometimes among ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Princes, we ſee few of 'em, whoſe <hi>Meen</hi> does denote the Elevation of his Rank. This is an advantage which we admire in the Perſon of the great Monarch, to whom you ſhall be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented, when I ſhall find you uſed to Converſation, and the Manners of the Men of the World. I will carry you firſt to ſeveral Perſons of the Court, to the end that going afterwards to <hi>Verſailles,</hi> you appear there the leſs ſurpris'd, and that you may find Perſons to whom you may ſpeak: It is there, more than in any Place of the World, that you will meet with Perſons of all Airs which we have diſcourſed of. It is here that you will find more politeneſs and leſs Affectation, than in any Court in the World. Moſt here have the Air gallant, and there's ſcarcely any one but has a certain eaſie Air, which makes all the agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs in Converſation.</p>

<pb n="141" facs="tcp:60459:81"/>
one another, and they both pleaſe almoſt in the ſame manner. Yet what we call agreeableneſs is more general, it ſuits with more things, it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuates it ſelf more ſweetly, it reaches to the Heart and touches it. The Air Gallant takes an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other courſe, it ſeizes on the Fancy, and gains Eſteem: But to ſpeak in general, nothing can pleaſe in Perſons who have not a good Air. It's true, that one may in ſome ſort obtain it, in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing careful that ones Action be free, and in ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring a facility of Speaking.</p>

                     <p>THE Reading every day of Books, and the People whom we every moment converſe with, may ſerve as an inſenſible and continual Preparation for the Converſations wherein Chance may engage us.

                        <p>This is the juſteſt compariſon we can make of it; when we learn things agreeable, or inſtructive, we only intruſt them to our Memories; this is a Pledge which ſhe keeps only to reſtore it.

Succeſſes, as ſurprizing Marriages, unexpected Promotions, in a Word, whatever has happen'd that is pleaſing in the Revolutions wherein For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune has been pleaſed to Favour thoſe ſhe loves.

                        <p>I had already profitably uſed that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to Embaſſadors. When the <hi>Algerins</hi> came to make their Submiſſions to the King; I fail'd not to inſtruct my ſelf in what might be ſaid of theſe Pirates, on their little State, their Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, their Ships, and the Forces of their Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia, which they dare call invincible.</p>
                        <p>I had leſs pains in informing my ſelf on the Riches and Commerce of <hi>Genoa,</hi> the Magnificence of thoſe Palaces, which make her have the Title of Proud, and I eſpecially enquired into the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the <hi>Doge,</hi> ſeeing he was the Chief of the Republick, whom ſhe was obliged to ſend into <hi>France.</hi> You may eaſily judge I had not the ſame facility in learning of the Kingdom of <hi>Siam</hi> what I would know of it. But the Embaſſie which came from ſo far a Country, being too extraordinary, not to be the ſubject of all Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſations, I read Relations enough, to find wherewith to make my ſelf be hearken'd to in ſpeaking of the <hi>Siamoiſes.</hi>

<pb n="146" facs="tcp:60459:84"/>
of my advice in this matter; I ſhall only adviſe you to recal every Night the Ideas of what you have heard ſay, that is moſt agreeable and moſt inſtructive, and to examine after what manner, or by what diſcourſe, certain Perſons have had the opportunity of pleaſing, in the time when others could not be heard, tho' they were brim full of diſcourſe.</p>
                        <p>But here's enough for to Night, it is time to end this Diſcourſe, and to leave one another. You ſhall have brought you to Morrow Morning wherewith to Cloath you handſomly, and it is fit that <hi>Eraſtus,</hi> who is to come to take us with him, ſhould find you ready to go along with him. We will go and ſee Perſons of great diſtinction, and to whom I would very gladly have you go ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times. You muſt be preſented to them by <hi>Era<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtus,</hi> he can recommend you in ſuch a manner, as is not proper for me to do, and I am ſure he will have no leſs Addreſs than Affection, when he is to do you good Offices.</p>

for your own ſake, that you accommodate your ſelf to the Humour of the Perſons from whom you expect good Offices? Do you take for Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimulation a ſtroak of Prudence which requires you to ſeem to enter into the Sentiments of a Man whom you would very willingly draw into yours, when your Intereſts require it? For my part I think you have right to applaud your ſelf, when you can inſinuate your ſelf into oppoſite Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours: What Pleaſure is it, in diſcourſing with a Learned General, to cite the Inſtructions which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> gave to <hi>Alexander,</hi> the Eloquence which made <hi>Caeſar</hi> famous before his Conqueſts, and the Politeneſs of <hi>Scipio,</hi> to whom it's ſaid <hi>Terence</hi> owes that which appears in his Works.

moment, that the Commerce of Life requires that we ſpeak indifferently in the ſame Day. I ſhould be wanting in Civility, if I did not go and rejoice with a Friend who had married ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantagiouſly, and I ſhould yet commit a more conſiderable Fault, ſhould I not appear ſenſible of the Afflictions of one of my Relations, who had juſt loſt his only Son. A Man that will on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly live for himſelf alone, and take no part in what may happen to others, muſt renounce the World, and retire with his Indolency into Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.

                        <p>Nothing is more oppoſite to the Maxims of the civil Society than this Conduct, and a Perſon who ſhall obſtinately follow it, will be in Danger of never getting Friends. All the Ancients have admir'd the eaſie Humour of <hi>Alci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biades,</hi> and we ſtill wonder that a Man could ſo well accommodate himſelf to the different man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of Countries where he lived. Nothing was ſo much talk'd of at <hi>Athens,</hi> as his Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence and Gallantry. Among the <hi>Perſians</hi> he was always feaſting, and nothing was ſeen more ſplendid than his Dreſs and Equipage. But he paſt over to other oppoſite Manners, when he was oblig'd to go to <hi>Sparta.</hi> The moſt regid <hi>Lacedemonian</hi> led a Life leſs auſtere than his <hi>Pharnacius:</hi> It's certain, that <hi>Alcibiades</hi> was not content with following the diverſe Cuſtums of Nations, but he moreover diſtinguiſh'd himſelf by a more exact regularity in practiſing them.</p>

This occaſion of doing it offers it ſelf too naturally to neglect it. Will you refuſe, <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rante,</hi> to let me know wherein this Hereſie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted?</p>

                        <p>You well judge, Madam, that I will do what you pleaſe, yet you muſt permit me not to enter on particulariſing the Errors which the Quietiſts followed.</p>
                        <p>For thus were thoſe call'd who embrac'd this Sect. They drew this Name from the Reſt they pretended to enjoy when they had rais'd their Souls to Contemplation by the means of a Prayer they recited. They held it was ſufficient for them to make an Act of Faith, and ſet them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the Preſence of God, and to rely whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on his Providence. This was methinks a good way to draw abundance of People; whether that being lazy, they chuſe rather to yield themſelves up after this manner that they may not act; or that they had the Vanity to believe themſelves capable of well contemplating. If Women, as you now ſay, are not the Authors of Hereſies, yet we ſee 'em ready enough to follow thoſe
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:60459:90"/>
they are taught, as either being deſirous of new things, or ſuffering themſelves to be taken with the fine appearances, wherewith the Errors which are propoſed be generally diſguiſed. However it be, ſeveral Perſons of your Sex followed the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions of <hi>Molinos</hi> the Chief of the Quietiſts. It is true, this <hi>Spaniard</hi> paſſed for a Saint before he was diſcovered to be an <hi>Hereſiarch.</hi> You know, Madam, that he has abjured his Errors, and that he is ſhut up for the reſt of his Life.</p>

                        <p>One may in a Converſation relate the Hiſtory of an Hereſie, recite the Eſtabliſhment of it, the Progreſs and Decay of it; for there is none but we have ſeen deſtroyed in the end.</p>

                        <p>However we ſhould never mix with theſe Relations, any thing which may make theſe Novelties reliſh. They are ſometimes more dangerous than the Opinions of Libertines. To convince theſe latter, I need only entreat them to conſider the Courſe of the Sun, the Motions of the Stars, and the productions of the Earth. They will ſee that Man could not ſet that Order which we admire in the Univerſe, he that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not regulate ſo much as a ſimple Digeſtion in himſelf, and who has been ſo long ignorant of the Circulation of the Blood in his own Veins. Muſt it not be acknowledged that he who ſo well governs ſo vaſt a Machin, muſt needs be a wiſe and infinitely powerful Being; and if he be ſuch a one as we ſay, can we refuſe him our Adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions? I would willingly know after what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner we ſhould regulate the Worſhip which ſhould ſerve to teſtifie our Acknowledgment and our Submiſſion? Muſt this be the Fancy of ſome frantick <hi>Enthuſiaſt,</hi> or by the Pious Maxims of
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:60459:90"/>
great and holy Perſonages which have been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways in the Univerſal Church? This matter is too fine and large to be included in our Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments. Inſtead of engaging our ſelves there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, it is ſufficient to make known to you in few words, that it is no hard matter to ſhut the Mouths of the Libertines, provided they prefer not their Obſtinacy to the Reaſons wherewith one may convince them.</p>
                        <p>However I would not have thoſe who maintain the right ſide to appear puft up with their advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages; they muſt ſpeak with good ſenſe, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, and without ſharpneſs and oſtenation.</p>

                        <p>I Will ſpeak then, ſeeing you enjoyn me, and will firſt ſay that I put a great difference between Foreign Affairs and thoſe which relate to us. We may ſpeak our opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons touching the Government of other Nations with as much boldneſs as <hi>Beliſe</hi> does, ſuppoſing we underſtand the Intereſts and Maxims of them. But when we are pleaſed to diſcourſe on the State under which we live, we ſhould never ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend our conjectures too far, nor affect to appear too penetrating. You know nothing does more contribute to the happy ſucceſs of an enterpriſe, than the ſecrecy obſerv'd therein. The Captains themſelves whom the King chuſes to excute his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns, commonly know what they are going about, and learn it only by the Orders which they muſt not open, but at certain times, and in certain Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. After ſuch exact precautions, can our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs be mention'd with an affirmative tone? Dare we reaſon on uncertain conjectures? Perſons of good ſenſe never talk of thoſe matters but with great modeſty, and for my part I can only for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give this imprudence in Perſons who are incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:60459:92"/>
of making any reflexion. How many do we hear every Day cenſuring that Government which they do not underſtand, they make War and Peace according to their Fancy, and wholly buſie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in hearing News, and modelling the affairs of State, when their Families at home are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps ready to ſtarve for want of Bread.</p>
                        <p>It's true, that ſince the King has ſo conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly encreaſed his States, the Govenment is not ſo much ſpoke againſt.</p>

The Second, That it be ſucceſſive. And the Third, at which I am not a little griev'd, deprives the Perſons of our Sex of the ſucceſſion to the Crown.

They affirm, that the Law, which requires the State to be Monarchical, and to be ordered in the manner we now related, was never written but in the Hearts of the People. They paſs farther, and believe there never was any <hi>Pharamond.</hi> They ground themſelves on that <hi>Gregory</hi> of <hi>Tours,</hi> who wrote the Hiſtory of the <hi>French,</hi> ſpeaks not a word of <hi>Pharamond,</hi> and it is certain that he would never have failed to mention a Prince, who was the firſt King of the Nation, of which he had undertaken to leave us the moſt conſiderable adventures. <hi>Beliſe</hi> will inform you of ſeveral o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther particulars.</p>

                        <p>It is certain, that Diviſions do eaſily get a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Perſons who ſhare the Soveraignty, and that it is very difficult keeping a Secret among them; judge then what we may fear from one and the other. Moreover, a King is too much accuſtomed to Grandure, to appear giddy-headed with it; whereas it is but too often ſeen, that Citizens, who are immediately exalted to the
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:60459:93"/>
Throne, become intolerable through their Pride.</p>

                        <p>Well, you have ſaid enough; pray now let's ſee whether <hi>Eraſtus</hi> will declare himſelf for the Regal Succeſſion, or for Elective Kingdoms. What ſay you, Sir, Do you judge the People in a better Condition who have a Right to chuſe their Soveraigns, than thoſe who are obliged to receive them, for better for worſe, from the Hands of Nature?</p>
                     </sp>

                        <p>You do not conſult me on a matter difficult enough to gain me any Credit; and there is no body but may eaſily determine him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf herein. We ſee it ſeldom happen, but that the Preſumptive Heir of the Kingdom is Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted according to the Rank which he muſt one Day poſſeſs. Such Sentiments of Clemency and Equity are inſpired into him, as may contribute to the Peoples Happineſs; whereas the like E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducation is not beſtowed on particular Perſons, who are too far diſtant from the Throne, to make it thought that they will one day poſſeſs it. Judge of the Factions which are form'd for an Election of this Importance; and into what Wars theſe Factions may draw the People. Theſe Troubles are not fear'd in ſucceſſive King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, therein happens no change. If a King dies, his Son takes his Place, and ſeveral Reigns appear but one continued Reign.</p>
                        <p>It is not to be ſuppoſed, that only Perſons re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable for their Virtues are choſen, and in whom there can be found no Fault, ſeeing theſe Perſons uſe all their Induſtry to diſſemble and hide their Vices, and to adorn themſelves with Qualities becoming their Ambition: But when they have gotten their Aim, and have nothing
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:60459:94"/>
more to deſire or fear, they then throw off their Masks, and abandon themſelves to all manner of Diſſoluteneſs. I could give a great many Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of this; but you will find enough in the Roman Hiſtory, if you will take the Pains to read it.</p>

                        <p>It troubles me, Madam, that I am not ſo ſenſible of the Honour you do me, and to tell you that the <hi>Salic</hi> Law had an admirable fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight in this third part which you condemn. If this Kingdom ſhould fall into the Feminine Line, and we ſaw a preſumptive Heireſs of the Crown, to what Miſery ſhould we not be reduced? In effect, ſhould it happen that the Princeſs would chuſe a Husband among her Subjects, thoſe who expect this Honour, would make ſtrong Parties, and carry things to a greater extremity, than in Elective Countries, ſeeing the prize is no leſs than a Crown, which would paſs to their Deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants, and remain for ever in their Family. He that has the good fortune to be preferred, will be ſo unhappy as to be hated of his Rivals, the greateſt Men at Court, and who will never faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ſerve him. If on the contrary, the Hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſs of a Kingdom ſhould caſt her eyes on a neighbouring Prince, to beſtow on him her Heart, and her Scepter; we ſhould fall under the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of a ſtranger, our Monarchy would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a Province of his States.</p>

                        <p>I am perſwaded that what does moſt contribute to the juſtneſs of a diſcourſe is, when there happens a real relation, or a real oppoſition between the terms, and between the things which are put together. Thus I ſhould not ſpeak juſtly ſhould I ſay that <hi>Liſidor</hi> is of <hi>Provence,</hi> and <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemon</hi> an Officer of the Kings; ſeeing there is no relation, nor oppoſition between a Country and an Office.

I return Graces to a Perſon who has 'em infinitely. This is properly what we may call a <hi>Galamathias,</hi> and it is very hard to underſtand two words which are tyed together without any relation. In effect, in the firſt Place the Word <hi>Graces</hi> ſignifies only thanks, and the other Word which is underſtood, is only taken for ſome a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greableneſs of the Countenance, or of the Perſon. I might moreover give you infinite Examples on this defect of juſtneſs, but I ſhall content my ſelf with telling you, that it is chiefly in compariſons, where it is to be chiefly avoided.</p>
                        <p>I ſhould ſpeak ill, ſhould I ſay that the <hi>Barbe Iſabella</hi> of <hi>Philemon</hi> is as fine as the Diamond which <hi>Eraſtus</hi> wears, tho' it be permitted me to eſteem one as much as the other, and to offer an Hundred <hi>Lewis</hi>'s for the Horſe as well as for the Ring.

                        <p>I now undeſtand what is contrary to the juſtneſs of an expreſſion, and you imagine well that the reſt of the Company comprehends it yet better. And therefore we may ſpeak of the matter which <hi>Cleonice</hi> has giv'n us, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge in the beginning, that there is nothing ſo dangerous as the paſſions. For my part I am perſwaded, that could our Hearts free themſelves from their Tyranny, we ſhould enjoy a ſerene and happy Life.</p>

                        <p>It's true, that the greateſt part of the World regards Ambition, Love and Hatred as the
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:60459:96"/>
Springs of all Evils, and it is commonly their vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence which leads to the committing of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtices which we ſee in the World.</p>

                        <p>We grant you that the impetuoſity of the paſſions hurries but too often to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting of crimes, but can ſhe not likewiſe be of great uſe in the leading us to Heroick Virtue? Without Ambition we ſhould ſee no Conqueror, hear nothing of <hi>Alexander</hi> nor <hi>Caeſar,</hi> and none of thoſe glorious Actions would be perform'd which procure an immortal Reputation. So that inſtead of condemning the Paſſions, I rather wiſh a good uſe were made of them, and that they were rendred profitable. We love the effects of Clemency and Compaſſion, we admire that which the love of Glory produces, and the ſequel of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famy. And however decry'd Fear is, yet in a thouſand occaſions ſhe makes up one part of Prudence. It is from her that we foreſee evils, and avoid them. What may we not moreover obſerve, if we examine the other paſſions?</p>

                        <p>It ſeems to me that we have only the paſſion of Love to examine, there being ſcarcely any other but it. It takes different names ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the difference of its objects. Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is only the love of Greatneſs; Covetouſneſs the love of Riches; and Hatred, which appears ſo oppoſite to Love, is, to ſpeak properly, only a diſguiſed Love; ſeeing we have only averſion for that which is offenſive to us, becauſe we love our own preſervation.</p>

<pb n="171" facs="tcp:60459:96"/>
which feel it, you will find few that can tell you what it is. You may be perſwaded of what I ſay by this Philoſopher, who ſays that Love is I know not what, that comes from I know not where, and goes away I know not how.</p>

                        <p>We are ſo little accuſtomed to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large our ſelves on this Subject we ſpeak of, and to engage our ſelves in Subtilties which ſerve on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to tire the Mind, that I do not think we ought to diſcuſs the Nature of Paſſions. Thoſe who are minded to inform themſelves farther, may read the Works we have on this Subject, and in the mean time content themſelves with the Diſtinctions which we have promiſed to bring. It muſt be acknowledg'd that we are to blame in condemning the Paſſions, and in being afraid of them. They are indifferent in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and if it happens they ſometimes diſturb the Tranquility of our Life; there are other Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions wherein they are of great Help to us. Men without Boldneſs, would they march to Glory through Fatigues and Dangers? Let's make another Diſtinction, Shall we call a Man valiant who has done a great Action by an Impetuoſity of Boldneſs, and ſhall we accuſe of Cowardiſe a Perſon that panick Terror has ſeiz'd in ſome Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion? True Valour is, when in every Rencoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter our Courage diſpoſes us to vanquiſh the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacles which oppoſe our Deſigns; as a Man muſt not paſs for a Coward, but when 'tis his Cuſtom to avoid Danger. Thus we may reaſon on the other Vices, and on the other Virtues. A Magiſtrate is not to be praiſed as juſt, for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving done Juſtice once. To merit this Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, he muſt be in a firm and conſtant Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:60459:97"/>

                        <p>Are you willing to begin with Shame? Women will be very much obliged to you. You will free them from a Paſſion which keeps them in a ſtrange ſort of Bondage.

                        <p>It's true, that Shame ſerves as a Guard for our Women, and there are other Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions which are neceſſary for the Commerce of Life.

                        <p>But is there not a Mixture of Envy in Emulation?</p>

                        <p>Nothing is more different than theſe two Paſſions. Emulation is lively and generous, and Envy baſe and malicious. The firſt is a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret at our ſmall Deſert, the other a Vexation which ariſes from the Merit of others. Emula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion would raiſe us, and Envy would abaſe what
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:60459:97"/>
is above us. In fine, nothing is more worthy of our Contempt than Envy, nothing is more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable than Emulation. It made <hi>Caeſar</hi> weep at the Sight of <hi>Alexander</hi>'s Picture, and hindred <hi>Themiſtocles</hi> from ſleeping near the Trophies of <hi>Miltiades.</hi> You know what <hi>Caeſar</hi> and <hi>Themiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles</hi> afterwards executed.</p>

There was ſeen heretofore in <hi>Greece</hi> a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick wherein Theft was pardoned, provided it was committed dexterouſly; and you know well that Robbery found not the ſame Impunity in any other Country.</p>

                        <p>Every body does not regard it in the ſame manner, and I know not whether it will not puzzle us to ſay preciſely what it is. It's true, there is a natural Equity which is generally ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved; but it is not leſs certain that it is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſly practiſed. There never was any Obligation more indiſpenſable, than that requiring Children to ſerve thoſe who brought them into the World, eſpecially when they are grown old, and find themſelves afflicted with Diſeaſes. All the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:60459:98"/>
of <hi>Europe</hi> obſerv'd ſo juſt a Maxim; and yet the <hi>Scythians,</hi> who poſſeſt more Country than <hi>Europe</hi> comprehended, accuſed thoſe Children of Inhumanity who let their Parents live under an incurable Malady. For their Parts they gave the fatal Blow as a Stroke of Grace, and thought it juſt to terminate thus their Parents Miſery. They extended further their pretended Charity. They eat their Bodies inſtead of burning or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terring them, imagining nothing more pious than to give this Sepulture to their Parents, for to change them into their proper Subſtance, and make them live again in themſelves as far as it was in their Power. Conſider this well. The <hi>Scythians</hi> commend a Man who comes from committing a Parricide, and other Nations pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh him as the greateſt Criminal.</p>

                        <p>In ſpeaking of the different Manners of People, we may cite the Punick Faith, which is to ſay, the little Fidelity the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd in their Promiſes. It's certain, the <hi>Romans</hi> had more Probity, and I ſhould have more rely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the Word of <hi>Regulus,</hi> than the Oaths of <hi>Hannibal</hi> and all his Army.</p>

                        <p>I think it more uſual to diſtinguiſh the Vices and Virtues according to the Profeſſions of Perſons, than according to the Cuſtoms of their Country. A Virtue renders us recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable only according as it is ſuitable to us. A Perſon conſecrated to the Service of the Altar ſhould prefer the Knowledge of Religion to all other Sciences, and his Piety muſt be ſo great as to make his, Words and Actions exemplary.

                        <p>It ſhould be the Virtue of all People, and had we all that ſtock of Equity neceſſary for the Commerce of Life, we ſhould need neither Law nor Magiſtrates. Men would render what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they are obliged to render, and they would begin by the Worſhip due to God.

                  <head>THE EARL of ESSEX: OR, THE AMOURS OF Q. <hi>ELIZABETH.</hi> PART I.</head>
                  <p>THE People had ſeen <hi>Eſſex</hi> in extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Favour with the <hi>Queen;</hi> and were therefore the more ſurpriz'd at his Fall. She had rais'd him to the higheſt Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities of her Kingdom; and he continued then General of her Army in <hi>Ireland,</hi> againſt the Earl of <hi>Tyrone,</hi> who had rais'd a Rebellion there. His Endeavours to divert his Misfortune were vain; and after an obſtinate Reſiſtance he was brought up to <hi>London,</hi> and confin'd to his Houſe.</p>
                  <p>The Services he had done the State by his Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, were very conſiderable: But the Favours the <hi>Queen</hi>'s Goodneſs had heaped on him, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded from a more ſecret Cauſe, and more preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Motives. Had the <hi>Earl of Eſſex</hi> never ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naliz'd
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:60459:104"/>
himſelf by the Glory of his Actions, the Kindneſs ſhe had for him would have made her diſtinguiſh him from the reſt of her Subjects: And 'tis certain, her Affection had made him her Favourite, before he could pretend to it in the leaſt by his Services. She was highly renowned above the Women of her Time, for Courage, and Strength of Mind; yet too weak to be Proof againſt the Impreſſions of Love. She had a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate Tenderneſs for the the unfortunate Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal, which was his Advocate, and defended him from the Severity of Juſtice; and was ſo far from taking Pleaſure in a publick Revenge of him, that ſhe abhorred in her Heart thoſe cruel Maxims that croſt her Inclinations.</p>
                  <p>She kept her Bed to prevent publick Diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of a Trouble it was not in her Power to hide; and admitting of no Company but the Counteſs of <hi>Nottingham</hi> (her intimate Confident) ſhe gave Vent to her Tears, and freely lamented the Misfortune that threatned the Repoſe of her Life.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Counteſs</hi> had a little ſuſpected the <hi>Queen</hi>'s Inclinations; and thought her ſelf oblig'd by powerful Reaſons to find out the Myſtery: But this being a tender Point, and having to deal with a <hi>Princeſs</hi> naturally of a very high Spirit, the <hi>Counteſs</hi> was ſilent. But the <hi>Queen</hi>'s Grief was too violent, to continue long mute: Her Sighs confirm'd the Suſpicions of the <hi>Counteſs;</hi> and her repeating in her Trouble the <hi>Earl of Eſſex</hi>'s Name, convinc'd the <hi>Counteſs</hi> of the Truth of what till then ſhe had but ſlightly fancy'd.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Counteſs</hi> had that Command of her ſelf, ſhe eaſily conceal'd her Concern in the Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:60459:104"/>
and appearing only ſenſible of the Trouble of the <hi>Queen,</hi> ſhe us'd all the Art ſhe had to comfort her; and fail'd not to put her in mind, how ſerviceable on that Occaſion her Virtue might be to her, which had already made her the Wonder of the World.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ah, Madam!</hi> (ſays the <hi>Queen</hi> interrupting her) <hi>You do not yet know me. The Force I have long put upon my ſelf, hath made you think, with the reſt of the World, that the Heighth of my Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, hath raiſed me above the Infirmities of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and the Greatneſs of my Thoughts, ſecur'd me from the Troubles of Life. But, alas! Poor</hi> Elizabeth <hi>is a Slave to her Weakneſs; and hath all this while but ſacrificed to Reputation all the Quiet of her Soul, and Happineſs of her Days. 'Tis high time, Madam, to reveal the Myſtery, my Heart, Madam, is ſenſible and ſuſceptible of the deepeſt Impreſſions: And what I have in Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, condemned moſt, is perhaps the only thing has moſt Power over me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The</hi> Earl of Eſſex <hi>is no leſs famous for the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorg gain'd over my Heart, than for his Treaſons againſt me: And I, who have maintain'd the Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of my Soul, and preſerv'd the Liberty of my Affection, from ſubmitting to the Efforts of all the Princes of</hi> Europe, <hi>and the Greateſt of my Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, have now the Misfortune to find my Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations violently ſway'd in Favour of a Perſon, as ungrateful as faithleſs. You know what I have done to raiſe him; nor can you be ignorant how ill he hath requited me by his Crimes. A Man, who being Governour of</hi> Ireland, <hi>General of my Army, in quiet Poſſeſſion of the beſt Offices of my Kingdom, and Maſter of my Affection; yet could
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:60459:105"/>
not forbear conſpiring againſt that Authority I was but too much inclin'd to give him a Share of; and perhaps, againſt a Life I took no other Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in, but the Opportunities I had by it to make his happy</hi>—</p>
                  <p>It was not in the <hi>Queen</hi>'s Power to ſay a Word more. And the <hi>Counteſs</hi> more than ordinarily concern'd at the Diſcourſe, grew ſo much the more curious; and pretending to comfort the <hi>Queen,</hi> engag'd her dexterouſly to a further Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>No, Madam,</hi> (replies the <hi>Queen) there's no Hope of Comfort for me, if the</hi> Earl of Eſſex <hi>dye. By the Condition you ſee his Impriſonment hath put me in, you may gueſs what I am like to be reduc'd to by his Death. His Crimes I abhor, but am in Love with his Perſon; and find, that as I have been ſo weak to let him know it, I ſhall again be ſo weak to pardon him all. You do not know his Carriage towards me. And perhaps my Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction will as eaſily find Excuſes for his Ingratitude, as it did for my Kindneſs. I will give you the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of it; but conjure you to reproach me ſo plainly with the Shame I expoſe my ſelf to, that I may at laſt prevail with my ſelf, to abandon the ingratefulleſt of Men, to the Rigour of his Fate.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I Shall not give you an Account of the Intereſts of <hi>England,</hi> otherwiſe than what the <hi>Earl of Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſex</hi> ſtands concern'd in. I will paſs by the Obſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles rais'd againſt my Eſtabliſhment; and tell you only, I quickly gain'd Poſſeſſion of the Throne, was ador'd of my People, and happy beyond the Hopes of a Perſon of my Sex. But <hi>Elevation</hi> is not always attended with the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:60459:105"/>
of Life; and that ſmooth Gale of Felicity and Repoſe in the Beginning of my Reign, quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly blew over, at leaſt, in my Opinion.</p>
                  <p>Being ſettled in my Government, I found my <hi>Court</hi> throng'd with Suitors of ſoveraign Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur, ſtriving to merit the Choice it was in my Power (at once) to make of a <hi>Husband,</hi> and a <hi>King:</hi> The Earls of <hi>Somerſet, Leiceſter, Arun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del,</hi> and <hi>Hertford,</hi> had moſt Right to pretend to it. But finding my ſelf diſturbed by their Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities in my moſt ſerious Affairs, and not at all inclin'd to entertain their Suits, I formally declar'd to them I deſign'd to live ſingle, and endeavoured to make them amends by conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Imployments, and Allyances I beſtow'd on them. Three of them openly quitted the Hopes they had conceived: Only the Earl of <hi>Leiceſter,</hi> more ambitious, or more conſtant than the reſt, kept afoot his Pretenſions, and publickly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued his Services: But it was not ordain'd his Perſeverance ſhould be crown'd with the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of my Affection.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Earl of Eſſex</hi> having ſignaliz'd himſelf againſt the rebellious Earls of <hi>Northumberland</hi> and <hi>Weſtmerland,</hi> made, about this Time, his firſt Appearance at <hi>Court;</hi> and found with more Eaſe the Secret to pleaſe me.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe who preſented him to me, ſpoke much in Commendation of him. And I was too much an Eye-witneſs of the Merit of his Perſon. I look'd upon him as an extraordinary Man. Nor could I but think it equally extraordinary, to find my ſelf ſo ſtrangely affected with him at the firſt Sight. The Reception I gave him, was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry obliging; and the Acknowledgments he made
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:60459:106"/>
me, were full of Repſect: So that for the Time, I ſaw no Cauſe to check my Inclination.</p>
                  <p>I may date from this firſt View, the Loſs of my Repoſe. I preſently fell into a Diſquiet I had till then been altogether a Stranger to: And in ſpight of my high Spirit, I could not but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly acknowledge the Cauſe. And all the Efforts of my haughty Humour againſt it, ſerv'd only to make the Triumph of the <hi>Earl of Eſſex</hi> more Glorious.</p>
                  <p>You would better comprehend the Condition I was in, did you know the Reſentments of a great Soul, jealous of its Reputation, in Extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of this Nature; the Combats it undergoes, and the Confuſion that attends the Defence.</p>
                  <p>I fear'd my Eyes would diſcover the Pleaſure I took in looking on the <hi>Earl of Eſſex,</hi> and my Weakneſs occaſion Diſcourſes in the World, to the Prejudice of my Glory. I ſhun'd the Sight of him; but to little purpoſe, when I carry'd the <hi>Idea</hi> of him in my Heart. I was angry with my ſelf for it, and ſummon'd my Reaſon to my Aſſiſtance to deface it: But <hi>Love</hi> had ſo violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſeiz'd my Heart, that I ſtruggle in vain to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſs him.</p>
                  <p>By little and little I yielded my ſelf Captive to that powerful Inclination which had at firſt Sight made me ſo much in Love with the Perſon of the <hi>Earl of Eſſex:</hi> And pretending the Servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces he had done me againſt the Earls of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thumberland</hi> and <hi>Weſtmerland,</hi> and the Memory I had of the good Services of his Father, as the Ground of my Favour, I made him <hi>Knight of the Garter, Maſter of the Horſe,</hi> and of the <hi>Privy-Council,</hi> though under Age.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="191" facs="tcp:60459:106"/>Thus did I cheriſh and indulge the Weakneſs I had ſo long ſtruggled with, and condemn'd my ſelf for. The higher he grew in Office, the dearer he was to my Perſon. His Complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance, his Reſpect, his Looks, (which to me appear'd all kind and languiſhing) and eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly my Affection, which had Tenderneſs enough to give a favourable Conſtruction to the leaſt of his Actions, conſpir'd to betray me.</p>
                  <p>Envy rais'd him Enemies: The Earl of <hi>Leice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> (concern'd to be jealous of him) quickly ſuſpected the Truth. And looking on the <hi>Earl of Eſſex,</hi> as a Perſon of Merit, capable to croſs his Pretenſions, he made it his Buſineſs to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plant him; which I preſently obſerv'd. I eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly foreſaw the Trouble my Favour might cauſe between Perſons ſo conſiderable: And the better to countenance the Kindneſs I had for <hi>Eſſex,</hi> I affected a little Complaiſance for <hi>Leiceſter,</hi> which ſomewhat abated the Edge of his Jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie.</p>
                  <p>About that time, the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Sweden,</hi> the <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour,</hi> for his Son, and the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Anjou,</hi> made me their ſeveral Propoſals of Marriage, which I was forc'd to receive; but wanted not Pretences to ſend home their Embaſſadours, without any Fruit of their Negotiation.</p>
                  <p>How contrary to the real Motive of my Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, were the Interpretations Men made of my Refuſal of Marriage with theſe <hi>Princes!</hi> It re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dounded much to my Honour; my Glory was increas'd by it, and the World admir'd my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of <hi>Love,</hi> even then when my Soul was wholly poſſeſt by it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="192" facs="tcp:60459:107"/>The Averſion I expreſt for Foreign Alliances, rais'd the Hopes of the Earl of <hi>Leiceſter;</hi> and <hi>Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſex</hi> ſeem'd overjoyed at it: <hi>Not</hi> (ſaid he, as I heard afterwards) <hi>but that the</hi> Queen <hi>is diſcreet in all her Actions; and her Choice, had ſhe made one, had been decent and juſt: But that I think her ſo fit to reign alone, that I could not without extream Trouble, ſee her ſhare her Authority with a Husband, who perhaps would in time be her Maſter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Conſtruction I made of the <hi>Earl of Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſex</hi>'s Zeal, was ſuitable to my Affection, and the Deſire I had of gaining his Heart; which I wiſh'd ſo paſſionately, that I fancy'd it done, and that the pretended Severity, that made me ſlight <hi>Kings,</hi> was the only thing that frightned his Reſpect; and that he had declared his Love to me, could he have thought he durſt preſume to do it.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Alanſon</hi> (not diſcourag'd by my Refuſal of his Brother) began ſoon after to make Addreſſes for himſelf; and it was not in my Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to deny my Conſent for his Voyage to <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don.</hi> But what Advantages ſoever he pleaded in his Favour, certain it is, the <hi>Earl of Eſſex</hi> loſt not any he had gain'd over me. The Stay of that <hi>Prince</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> fortify'd the <hi>Earl</hi>'s Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt: He was conſtantly at my Elbow. When the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Alanſon</hi> ſpoke to me, methought I read Reproaches againſt my ſelf, in the <hi>Earl of Eſſex</hi>'s Eyes. The Earl of <hi>Leiceſter</hi> watched me as carefully; though not with equal Regard from me. I rais'd ſo many Difficulties againſt the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Alanſon</hi>'s Deſign, that he was forc'd to deſiſt: And I rid my Hands of his Perſon, and
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:60459:107"/>
his Suit, without giving him Cauſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint.</p>
                  <p>You know that after the Death of the <hi>Queen</hi> of <hi>Scots,</hi> the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Spain</hi> (who ſtill makes himſelf indiſpenſibly ſubject to a Neceſſity of oppoſing me) enter'd into a League with the Pope againſt me. And having fill'd the World with injurious Declarations againſt my Right to the Crown, they joyn'd all their Forces to pull it off my Head. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> made themſelves on the ſudden Maſters of <hi>Daventer:</hi> The <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Parma</hi> laid Seige to <hi>Sluys.</hi> It was high Time to provide for Defence; and the <hi>Earl</hi> of <hi>Leiceſter</hi> was ſent away with all the Nobility of the Kingdom, in the Head of a numerous Army.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Earl of Eſſex</hi> was one of the firſt to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him; and as ſtrongly inclin'd as I was to ſtay him, yet I thought the Man I lov'd ought not to be idle when he had Opportunity by Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Actions to merit the Kindneſs I had for him.</p>
                  <p>I will not ſpend Time in giving you a Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a War, which perhaps you are ſufficiently inform'd of, and concerns not the Secrets of my Life. It tended to our Advantage; all (to the very Winds) having favour'd our Side. When the Generals of the Army arriv'd at <hi>London,</hi> I was carry'd in Triumph to St. <hi>Pauls:</hi> yet the Joy I had to ſee the <hi>Earl of Eſſex,</hi> was greater than that for the ſignal Victory obtain'd. Amongſt an infinite Number of Perſons of ſeveral Ranks, my Eyes were fix'd only on him: And much ado I had, ſometimes, out of Policy, to caſt a Look on the Earl of <hi>Leiceſter.</hi> Both of them had done very great Actions: I commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:60459:108"/>
them publickly; and particularly joy'd the <hi>Earl of Eſſex,</hi> for the Succeſs of his Valour and Conduct; who ſpoke ſo much in Praiſe of the Valour and Conduct of the Earl of <hi>Leiceſter,</hi> that he was forc'd in Requital, to do him Right, in giving him openly the Elogies he deſerv'd.</p>
                  <p>Not long after this Expedition, the <hi>Earl of Eſſex</hi> fell into a very deep Melancholy. I was the firſt that perceiv'd it; and took it for an Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of ſome ſecret Paſſion. I wiſh'd now and then he would once take the Boldneſs to declare himſelf, but preſently my Reaſon, upon <hi>ſecond Thoughts,</hi> ſet before my Eyes the Confuſion would certainly follow an Explication of that Nature, to the Ruine of my Reputation, and that high Eſteem the World had for me: Yet (to ſpeak Truth) I could not reſolve what to do, or to wiſh. I am in Love, I deſir'd to be lov'd again; and that was all I could make of it</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Earl of Eſſex,</hi> in the mean time continu'd ſad. I was troubled to ſee him ſo; and fancy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my ſelf the Cauſe, I was deſirous to know it; and reſolv'd to fetch it out of him.</p>
                  <p>He had full Liberty of Acceſs to me, and I enlarg'd it daily: But not to expoſe my Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in forcing him to declare himſelf, I pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed an Inclination to favour the Earl of <hi>Leiceſter;</hi> who, ſince his late Victories, had entertain'd new Hopes.</p>
                  <p>One Day, as the <hi>Earl of Eſſex</hi> came to thank me for the Government of <hi>Ireland</hi> I had beſtow'd on him, I was loth to loſe the Opportuity; and interrupting what he would have ſaid in Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment: <hi>You need not enlarge your ſelf</hi> (ſaid I) <hi>on a thing I am fully aſſur'd of. I take
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:60459:108"/>
Pleaſure in raiſing your Fortune; and wiſh I could as eaſily remove your Melancholy, as I am pleas'd to give a new Proof of the Senſe I have of your Service. You may; in your Turn, oblige me</hi> (ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded I) <hi>who am fallen into a troubleſome Conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, and find it very difficult to reduce my Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections into a Compliance with the Neceſſity of the State. This preſſes me hard, to provide</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land <hi>a King: This Choice is difficult; and I have not a mind to make it among Foreigners. You are diſcreet, and (I have Reaſon to believe) not the leaſt loving of my Subjects. I will take your Advice; ſpeak your Mind freely, what Man in</hi> England <hi>you think beſt deſerves this Fortune?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I look'd on him with that Kindneſs, as would have inſpir'd the moſt fearful with Boldneſs: I obſerv'd in his Eyes extraordinary Emotions, and all the Symptoms of a Secret ready to break out. The Point appear'd Tender, and My Imagination flatter'd Me, all would be as I wiſh'd. <hi>Your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties Reſolution</hi> (anſwers he) <hi>will render a Man more Glorious by the Quality of Your Husband, than of the Greateſt Monarch on Earth. Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> (ſaid I) <hi>I expect not a</hi> Panegyrick, <hi>but Advice from You: And that your Buſineſs at preſent, is to Nominate the Man I am to make</hi> King; <hi>not to Commend his good Fortune in being ſo. The Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is ſo nice, Madam,</hi> (replyed he) <hi>I dare not ſpeak my mind, though Your Majeſty order it. Did you know</hi> (ſaid I) <hi>what moves me to this Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in you, you would perhaps expreſs your ſelf with a great deal more Freedom. But becauſe to bring you to it, I muſt proceed further; tell me, whether you think the Earl of</hi> Leiceſter <hi>deſerves to be your</hi> Prince? <hi>The Earl of</hi> Leiceſter (anſwers
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:60459:109"/>
he) <hi>is Well Born, and a Perſon of Great Merit, and will anſwer the Honour your Majeſty intends him. Is that all you have to ſay to me,</hi> ſaid I? <hi>Ah, Madam</hi> (anſwers he, with a Sigh, which made me expect ſomething more Pleaſing) <hi>I ſhould have more to ſay to you for my ſelf, than the Earl of</hi> Lieceſter. <hi>What hinders you?</hi> ſaid I. <hi>The reſpect I have for your Majeſty,</hi> anſwered he. <hi>I am in Love, Madam; but 'tis not a thing fitting to make my</hi> Queen <hi>my Confident.</hi> I Bluſh'd at thoſe Words, and was in a Mind not to proceed further. But I look'd upon him, and there need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed no more to declare my Weakneſs: <hi>I have that eſteem for you,</hi> added I, <hi>that I am not unwilling to be of your Council. Well, Madam, ſince you will have it ſo,</hi> continues he, <hi>I muſt acquaint You, I am deſperately in Love with the Counteſs of</hi> Rut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land; <hi>and that I cannot Live, if Your Majeſty conſent not that ſhe ſhall make me happy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>You may eaſily gueſs what an Aſtoniſhment I was in at this Explication; having upon ſo good Grounds expected to have heard My Self named; it was well for me, I had not altogether loſt the Haughtineſs of my Nature: the Poor Remains of it were my only Help to preſerve me from diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering more Weakneſs to the <hi>Earl,</hi> then he had diſcover'd Love for his Miſtreſs. His Tranſports help'd me to cover mine. He perceiv'd not the Blow he had given me. And ſacrificing my Grief to my Glory, I affected to appear calm and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concern'd, when my Soul was full of Trouble and Confuſion. <hi>You have made a good Choice,</hi> ſaid I, <hi>and the Counteſs of</hi> Rutland <hi>will very well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the Kindneſs you profeſs for her. Madam,</hi> replies he, with Satisfaction in his Looks, which
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:60459:109"/>
heightned my Grief, <hi>You have done more for me, in approving the Paſſion I have for the Counteſs of</hi> Rutland, <hi>than You could have done, had You procur'd me the Empire of the Univerſe. It is your Deſire then,</hi> added I, with a Sigh my De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair forc'd from me, <hi>that I ſhould give her to you. I deſire any thing,</hi> ſays he, <hi>that may preſerve me from dying for Love of her. Go your way then,</hi> ſaid I, to be rid of him, and eaſe my ſelf of the intollerable Conſtraint I was under, <hi>Be aſſured, I will concern my ſelf in your Amour: You ſhall know it in time. But take heed you give not the Earl of</hi> Leiceſter <hi>the leaſt intimation of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret I have imparted to you. Not before I have Order from your Majeſty,</hi> anſwer'd he, <hi>to congra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulate his Happineſs, and pay him the Devoirs of an Affectionate Subject.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Had you ſeen with what an Ayr he pronounced theſe words, you would have abhorr'd him for his Ingratitude. As for me, I was left in ſo deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate a Condition, it was long e're I could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover my Reaſon out of the Entanglements of <hi>Love, Anger,</hi> and <hi>Jealouſie.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I was partly the Author of my Misfortune, by calling to Court the Counteſs of <hi>Rutland,</hi> after her Husband's Death, without conſidering ſhe was one of the handſomeſt Ladies on Earth; and but Sixteen Years old. I have not obſerved any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Kindneſs the <hi>Earl of Eſſex</hi> had for her: He viſited her as other Ladies of the <hi>Court.</hi> But their Intreague was myſterious; and the more ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly it was carry'd, the Engagement was the ſtronger, and the Affection more tender.</p>
                  <p>It is impoſſible to expreſs the Trouble I was in when <hi>Anger</hi> ſeiz'd the Place <hi>Grief</hi> had poſſeſt in
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:60459:110"/>
my Heart. Though the <hi>Earl of Eſſex</hi> had been ignorant of his good Fortune, I could not forbear reproaching him for ſlighting it as he did; and forgot not to charge him with Treachery and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude. But when I conſider'd he was ſo far from apprehending my meaning, that he was gone directly to make a ſolemn Tender of his Love to another, and carry her the joyful News of his Succeſs with me; I reſolved, at leaſt to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay the Pleaſure of it for a time; and went out of my Cloſet into my Chamber, to call him back. I thought I heard the <hi>Earl</hi> of <hi>Lieceſter</hi>'s Voice and his in the <hi>Anti-Chamber;</hi> and going to the Door, found I was not miſtaken. <hi>Leiceſter</hi>'s Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie, had, in all probability, made him watch <hi>Eſſex</hi> as he entered my Chamber; and when he ſaw him return with Satisfaction in his Looks; <hi>You are happy,</hi> ſays he, <hi>in a Priveledge, to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the</hi> Queen <hi>as long as you pleaſe; when others, who as paſſionately deſire it, cannot obtain that Happineſs for a moment. I am perſwaded,</hi> replies <hi>Eſſex, you better deſerve it; and make no doubt, but you will find more pleaſure in it. I will leave you at liberty to go in Search of it; and you may do me a Favour not to ſtay me, being call'd another way, on a very preſſing Occaſion.</hi> He had no ſooner ſaid ſo, but he went his way; and I was ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded with this new Sight, I ſcarce knew where I ſtood.</p>
                  <p>Having at length recover'd my Reaſon, I had the Diſcretion to hide my Weakneſs. Preſently my Anger would have vented it ſelf on the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſs of <hi>Rutland:</hi> But I conſider'd her only Crime was her Beauty; and that ſhe knew not my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern for her Servant.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="199" facs="tcp:60459:110"/>The Earl of <hi>Leiceſter</hi> having at his Entrance perceiv'd me in Diſorder, durſt not take notice of it; but after a ſhort Viſit, withdrew.</p>
                  <p>A little before, I had ſent to Congratulate the King of <hi>Navarre,</hi> upon his coming to the Crown of <hi>France;</hi> and having intelligence he wanted Aid to ſecure his Government, I reſolv'd to ſend him ſome under the Conduct of the <hi>Earl of Eſſex,</hi> in hopes his Abſence might Cure me. I would have perſwaded my ſelf, the Cauſe of my remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving him on that Occaſion, was my Deſire to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get him; but upon ſecond Thoughts, I muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, it was rather the Deſire of removing him out of the Sight of a beloved Rival.</p>
                  <p>Being reſolv'd on the Point, I haſtened the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution; and having ordered the <hi>Earl of Eſſex</hi> to attend me: <hi>You love Honour,</hi> ſaid I to him, <hi>and I cannot think you will prefer the Pleaſure of Sigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before a Miſtreſs, to the Opportunities of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring Glory: I have provided One for you; and am reſolv'd you ſhall Command the Troops I am ſending to the</hi> French King. <hi>And to fortifie your ſelf againſt the Troubles of Abſence, you need on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly think of the Pleaſures of a Return.</hi> His An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer was only in Sighs; and that paſſionate Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage made me haſten his Departure.</p>
                  <p>Soon after the Counteſs of <hi>Rutland</hi> (whom I could not forbear uſing very coldly) deſir'd leave to go into the Country, a conſiderable diſtance from <hi>London.</hi> I had then ſo little Love for her, I did not deſire to have her near me; but readily conſented ſhe ſhould retire.</p>
                  <p>The Hopes ſhe had to ſee the <hi>Earl of Eſſex</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, ſupported her ſo, that ſhe, with much mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, ſaw him take his leave: But I am aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſur'd
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:60459:111"/>
by Experience, the Grief for his Departure, equall'd (at leaſt) the Hopes for his Return.</p>
                  <p>When he was arrived in <hi>France,</hi> Fame ſpoke aloud in Commendation of him: his Abſence al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd not my Affection; and in ſpite of all I could do to the contrary, I had a ſenſible Pleaſure to hear him Commended.</p>
                  <p>Had I been deſired, I ſhould have call'd him home as ſoon as <hi>France</hi> was in Peace: But I ſent him new Orders to joyn Admiral <hi>Howard,</hi> who was going for <hi>Spain:</hi> And I gave him the like Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion for this Expedition, as for that of <hi>France.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He did Wonders in <hi>Spain:</hi> His ſingle Valour frightned the Enemies. And having taken <hi>Calis,</hi> and pillag'd the Coaſt of <hi>Portugal,</hi> he put again to <hi>Sea</hi> for <hi>England.</hi> The Fleet was ſcattered by a Storm, and we had News the <hi>Earl of Eſſex</hi> was loſt. Then it was I knew better than ever, the Kindneſs I had for him. I could no longer per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade my ſelf that his indifference for me deſerv'd mine for him.</p>
                  <p>I accus'd the Sea a Thouſand Times, for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving taken too unreaſonable a Revenge for me; and was under Sufferings more cruel than Death, when News was brought me, that by the Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Admiral of <hi>Holland,</hi> he was arrived at <hi>Plymouth;</hi> from whence, in few days he came to <hi>Court.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To ſhew you how little Reaſon we have, when we are in Love, and how fickle are the Reſolutions of a tender Heart, though provok'd by Slights and Contempts: I had lamented the Death of the <hi>Earl of Eſſex,</hi> and receiv'd the News of his being Alive with a Thouſand Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports of Joy. I was extreamly pleas'd with the
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:60459:111"/>
Report of his Arrival at <hi>London.</hi> But when I conſidered I ſhould ſee him full of Love for an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, and that perhaps I ſhould not be able to conceal my Jealouſie, I was tempted to order him to give the Council an Account of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, and not admit him into my Preſence. I was ſometimes of the Opinion, I ſhould be able to do ſo: But this weak Heart of mine, ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſs'd in favour of him, revolted againſt all my Reſolutions; I muſt follow my Inclinations, and ſee the moſt dangerous Enemy of my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, the Troubler of my Reſt. He came to <hi>Whitehall;</hi> I admitted him to my Preſence, I look'd upon him; and, ſpight of all my high Spirit, he ſaw nothing but Kindneſs in all my Actions.</p>
                  <p>You may imagine, what an agreeable Surprize it was to me, to find at our firſt Conference, that Abſence had wean'd his Affections from the Counteſs of <hi>Rutland.</hi> He appear'd no longer in that Languiſhing Melancholy I obſerv'd him in before his Departure: He had Satifaction in his Looks: The Air of his Actions were ſmooth and calm; and I fancy'd as much Joy in his Face, tho' the Counteſs of <hi>Rutland</hi> was abſent, as I felt in my ſelf, at the Explication he made. <hi>I ſee you again return'd with Victory,</hi> ſaid I: <hi>But am ſorry it is not in my Power to reward your Toil with a Sight of the Counteſs of</hi> Rutland. <hi>But if any thing I can do, can comfort you— I am eaſily comforted for her Abſence, when I am permitted to ſee your Majeſty,</hi> anſwered he. <hi>I have no paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion now, but for the Glory of Serving Your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty; and the Counteſs of</hi> Rutland <hi>is now to me no more than other Ladies of the Court. Are you
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:60459:112"/>
no longer in Love with the Counteſs of</hi> Rutland? replyed I, between Joy and Diſtruſt. <hi>You have ſpoken too faſt. When you ſee her again—When I ſee her again,</hi> ſays he, interrupting me, <hi>it ſhall be without thoſe Tranſports I expreſt for her, not forgetting the Reſpects due to Your Majeſty. What,</hi> anſwered I, <hi>are you not afraid of the Reproaches of a provoked Miſtreſs? No Madam,</hi> ſaid he, in a free and unconcern'd manner: <hi>All I am concern'd for, is to do my Duty, and approve my ſelf worthy Your Majeſties Favour. This,</hi> anſwer'd I, <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves my Acknowledgment; and time ſhall let you ſee I am not ungrateful.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus did the <hi>Earl of Eſſex</hi> aſſure me he was Cur'd of his firſt Paſſion: And I was in Hopes, it might be in my Power to ſee him one Day enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain another. A Week after, he deſir'd leave to go into the Country, about his private Affairs: He was abſent a Fortnight; and return'd more calm and unconcern'd than ever.</p>
                  <p>The Earl of <hi>Leiceſter</hi> had doubled his impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities in this Abſence of the <hi>Earl of Eſſex</hi> in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain;</hi> and obliged me at laſt, to put him out of Hopes. He is naturally Bold; and was ſo blown up with the Opinion of the Glory he had gain'd by ſome late Atchievments, that he proceeded to telling me plainly, <hi>He was jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous of the</hi> Earl of <hi>Eſſex:</hi> and would have made a Crime of the Diſcourſe I told you of, paſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them, as <hi>Eſſex</hi> left my Chamber. The An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer I made him, was an Abſolute Command, <hi>He ſhould be ſilent:</hi> Which was ſo far obey'd, that after ſome days Murmuring, he held his Peace. Yet this put me in mind to obſerve ſome meaſures, and not to follow openly my Inclinations.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="203" facs="tcp:60459:112"/>Things continu'd in this State, till the Troubles of <hi>Ireland.</hi> I have often open'd my Mouth, to let the <hi>Earl of Eſſex</hi> know the Advantges he had over me; but Modeſty ſhut it again: Yet ſeeing him under a Neceſſity of going for <hi>Ireland,</hi> when the <hi>Earl</hi> of <hi>Tyrone</hi> had rais'd a General Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion, I had not the Power to let him take leave without acquainting him, <hi>The Kingdom was at his Command.</hi> Upon the firſt News of the Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, he threw himſelf at my Feet, begging the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of my Command, to go Quiet thoſe Diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. <hi>You have done enough,</hi> ſaid I, <hi>and there's no need you ſhould (by expoſing your ſelf to New Dangers) oblige me to New Acknowledgments. I doubt not, Madam,</hi> (anſwer'd he) <hi>but the Favour I beg of your Majeſty, will be envy'd me: But I take the Boldneſs to ſay, Your Majeſty cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe it me, without doing your ſelf Injury: It be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an occaſion may contribute to meriting the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour you have already honour'd me with. The Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour you expreſs for undertaking Great Actions,</hi> Reply'd I, <hi>is not perhaps ſo Pleaſing as you ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine: And all the Good that may Redound to</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land <hi>through your Valour, is leſs conſiderable than the Trouble is given me, who take leſs Care of my Crown, than your Life. I am Ambitions: Yet— Ah! My Lord, ſave me the Confuſion of a more particular Explication of what you ought and might eaſily have long ſince underſtood. I might perhaps preſume too far in my Wiſhes,</hi> ſays the Earl, in ſome Diſorder. <hi>Wiſh boldly,</hi> anſwered I, <hi>I Love you; and if I bluſh to tell you ſo, 'tis not that I am either Aſham'd, or Repent of it. You may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve this Acknowledgment a very hard Task for a Perſon of my Humour, who have ſeen you ſigh for
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:60459:113"/>
another, when I ſlighted Kings for your Sake, and would have Sacrificed more to your Satisfaction. What Madam!</hi> cryes he, like a Man aſtoniſht, <hi>Have You lov'd me, and I been ſo unfortunate, to make my ſelf unworthy Your Kindneſs by thoſe Sighs I now diſavow? Did my Eyes never tell you what I look'd for in Yours?</hi> ſaid I. <hi>I never had the Boldneſs,</hi> anſwered he, <hi>to make any ſuch Conſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of your Looks. Your Fear was the effect of indifference,</hi> ſaid I; <hi>but no more of what is paſt. Tell me now, can ye love me? Rather ask me, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> anſwers he, <hi>if all the Affection of my Soul can merit Your love? And whether the</hi> Earl <hi>of</hi> Lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter, <hi>whom you deſign to make the Happieſt Man on Earth, ſhall not carry the Day from me? The</hi> Earl <hi>of</hi> Leiceſter, ſaid I, <hi>was but a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence to make you ſpeak. I told you then tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Thoughts I had of you. My Trouble for you was not ſmall, both in your Abſence, and ſince your Return: But all is forgotten. Be henceforth as I wiſh, and doubt not of being Happy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He anſwer'd me with ſome Diſorder, which I fancy'd the Effect of unexpected Joy. I thought it time to be no longer ſcrupulous; and that it was in vain to have any Reſerves, when I had ſaid ſo much. <hi>I will not let you go under any Uncertainty,</hi> proceeded I, <hi>but to convince you clearly of the Truth of what I've ſaid, take This,</hi> ſaid I, delivering him a RING, as the higheſt Mark of my Favour, <hi>keep it as a Pledge of my Kindneſs; which I conjure you to preſerve in the State it is in: And on that Condition, I promiſe you, never to deny you any thing you ſhall deſire of me, when you ſhew me this RING, though it coſt me my Life and my Fortune.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="205" facs="tcp:60459:113"/>His Joy and Acknowledgments at receiving the RING, were in Appearance, extraordinary and unparallel'd; and attended with Promiſes of as high a Nature.</p>
                  <p>He went for <hi>Ireland</hi> in few Days, leaving me fully perſwaded his Thoughts were wholly taken up with me. But he had ſcarce advanc'd up to the <hi>Rebels,</hi> but he was charg'd with all the Crimes which occaſion'd his Impriſonment, and that of the Earl of <hi>Southampton.</hi> Then it was, I began to repent I had not given Ear to the wholeſome Advice <hi>Cecil</hi> would have given me, concerning the ſecret Conduct of the <hi>Earl of Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſex.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In a Word, while my Thoughts were wholly imploy'd to make his Fortune glorious, he was plotting with the Earl of <hi>Tyrone,</hi> to ſurprize and make me Priſoner in this Palace.</p>
                  <p>You know the reſt, Madam; his obſtinate Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, his want of Reſpect for my Orders, his impriſoning my Miniſters, his murthering my Souldiers, and his intolerable Pride in all his Misfortunes.</p>
                  <p>Thus ended the <hi>Queen</hi>'s Diſcourſe; which ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving call'd freſh to her Mind all that had paſs'd between her and <hi>Eſſex,</hi> ſhe was more troubled than ever.</p>
                  <p>The Counteſs of <hi>Nottingham</hi> hath heard her with Attention ſuitable to her great Concern in the Diſcourſe. She, as well as the <hi>Queen,</hi> had been in Love with the <hi>Earl;</hi> and advanc'd ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Steps, but in vain, to raiſe a Paſſion in him: And having newly underſtood the Cauſe of his
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:60459:114"/>
ſlighting her, it added infinitely to her former Reſentments.</p>
                  <p>She had no mind to condemn the <hi>Queen</hi>'s Weakneſs, knowing her ſelf guilty of the like: Nor was ſhe inclin'd to ſpeak in Favour of a Man who was grown ſo much the more odious to her, as ſhe had formerly paſſionately lov'd him. She thought it ſufficient to comfort the <hi>Queen</hi> with Diſcourſes that ſeem'd to proceed only from Zeal for her Service; when, in truth, her Thoughts were wholly bent for the Ruine of an ingrateful Lover; who in her Judgment, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved nothing but Hatred at her Hands.</p>
                  <p>Though <hi>Love</hi> thought not fit the <hi>Earl of Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſex</hi> ſhould admire the Counteſs of <hi>Nottingham;</hi> yet another was her Captive, whoſe Character did (in a manner) make her amends: It was Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary <hi>Cecil;</hi> who amidſt his great Offices, and the Gravity that became them, diſcover'd in the Beauty, Ingenuity, and high Spirit of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſs of <hi>Nottingham,</hi> ſome Charms, that made him capable of a ſtrong Paſſion for her; which was heightned by the Hatred both of them had profeſs'd againſt the <hi>Earl of Eſſex; Cecil</hi> having always look'd on him as the invincible Obſtacle of his ambitious Pretenſions: And the Counteſs had againſt him all the Rage and Averſion that uſually ſucceed Kindneſs abus'd.</p>
                  <p>They were glad of the Impriſonment of the <hi>Earl of Eſſex;</hi> but the favourable Inclinations the <hi>Queen</hi> expreſt for him, alarm'd them.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Counteſs</hi> had no ſooner taken Leave of the <hi>Queen,</hi> but ſhe gave <hi>Cecil</hi> an Account of all ſhe had learnt. Having conſider'd the Conſequences, they concluded it neceſſary, while their <hi>Princeſs</hi>
                     <pb n="207" facs="tcp:60459:114"/>
ſigh'd ſecretly for the Priſoner, means ſhould be found by private Ways, and in artful Conduct, without their appearing to have any ſuch De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, to take away the Mercy which Love might inſpire into her.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Cecil,</hi> for the firſt Step, preſs'd the <hi>Queen</hi> to bring <hi>Eſſex</hi> to his Tryal; and caus'd certain News of his Death to be ſpread throughout <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Eſſex,</hi> in the mean time, was buſied with Thoughts of more Weight than thoſe of his Life. He knew well enough, his <hi>Queen</hi> lov'd him, and knew as well, he had deceiv'd her; and that ſhe might with a great deal of Juſtice not only <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach,</hi> but <hi>condemn</hi> him.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Queen</hi> had not ſeen him ſince his going into <hi>Ireland:</hi> But having not the Power to give him up to his ill Fortune, without having heard him, ſhe reſolv'd to go to his Houſe, where he was Priſoner, to reproach him as he deſerv'd; and endeavour, if poſſible, to find him innocent.</p>
                  <p>It is not far from <hi>Whitehall</hi> to <hi>Eſſex-Houſe:</hi> and the <hi>Queen</hi> took ſo good Order in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that no Notice was taken of the Undecency of the Viſit; having been introduced by her Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidents alone into the Chamber of the Criminal.</p>
                  <p>He was ſurpriz'd at the Preſence of the <hi>Queen:</hi> The languiſhing Condition ſhe was in, made her ſigh. All went for him, and the Victory ſeem'd eaſie. He ſaluted her with a profound Reſpect; and then fixing on her Face thoſe Eyes of his, which had ſo often charm'd her, he fetch'd ſome Tears from hers. <hi>Well, my Lord,</hi> (ſays ſhe, drying them) <hi>you ſee what I do for you notwithſtanding all the Crimes I can reproach you
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:60459:115"/>
with. I am come to you, and with a Deſign to hear you, if you have any thing to ſay to juſtifie your ſelf. I have lov'd you too well, not to wiſh it above all things: And, would Heaven were pleas'd, your Juſtification might be purchas'd with any (the moſt precious) Thing in my Power. My greateſt Crime is, that I thought my ſelf too happy, Madam,</hi> replyes the <hi>Earl,</hi> ſighing. <hi>Had you reſted there,</hi> ſaid the <hi>Queen, I ſhould have been too well ſatisfy'd to have complain'd of you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But to believe your ſelf happy, was it neceſſary you ſhould betray me? And, muſt you needs have made uſe of violent means, to make your ſelf Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of a Fortune I was willing to ſhare with you? What Reaſon could you have to ſeek the Protection of the Kings of</hi> Scotland <hi>and</hi> Spain? <hi>Did any In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts oblige you to ſecret Correſpondencies with</hi> Tyrone? <hi>And, was it for the Safety of my Perſon, you deſign'd to make me your Slave, and his? All you have done ſince to my Subjects, againſt my Orders? Are thoſe the Expreſſions of your Reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect? Is it by Fury and Treaſon you ſhew your Zeal for me and the Publick? Or, is all we have ſeen and heard of you, but Illuſion and Fancy? Yes, Madam,</hi> replies the <hi>Earl, thoſe Accuſations of Treaſon and ill Deſigns, have run me upon the deſperate Reſiſtance I made. You have been pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to heap Favours upon me; and I (too proud of what I ſo little deſerved) flatter'd my ſelf with Expectation of a thouſand Pleaſures which you had not abſolutely forbid me to hope for. This let looſe the Envy and Jealouſie of others againſt my good Fortune: They abus'd your</hi> Majeſty <hi>with Miſ-informations; and I had the Misfortunes to be aſſur'd your</hi> Majeſty <hi>had order'd I ſhould be
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:60459:115"/>
Arreſted; though my Innocence would have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded me the contrary. I confeſs, Madam, I was in a Rage, to ſee my Enemies inſult over me; being abandoned by your</hi> Majeſty, <hi>and on the Point of ſuffering (perhaps) a ſhameful Death. I thought it neither for my Reputation, nor your</hi> Majeſties <hi>Honour, I ſhould die as a Criminal. This put me upon having Recourſe to thoſe Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours and Aſſiſtances they reproach me with; and the Reſolution I took to go out of</hi> England, <hi>in hope to confound my Accuſers. But I found all the Paſſages ſtopt: And I muſt acknowledge, in that deſperate Condition, I vented my Fury, by taking Revenge on your Miniſters. They,</hi> Madam, <hi>and only they, were the Objects of the Rebellion I am charg'd with. My Deſign was, only they, who had ſo induſtriouſly labour'd to make me appear guilty, ſhould do me Right, in declaring my Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence; and permit me to lay it, and my Life at your</hi> Majeſties <hi>Feet. I never doubted, but your</hi> Majeſty <hi>would have done me the Honour to hear me: And that by a clear Diſcovery of the Truth, I ſhould have certainly confounded the Envy of my Enemies. But their Malice hath had the Succeſs to ſee me a Priſoner, hated by my Soveraign, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpis'd by the World, and made a Sacrifice to their Rage: And now what remains, but that I receive the Sentence of my Death pronounc'd by them; and ſee</hi> Cobham, Cecil, Rawleigh, <hi>and their Fellows, ſhare the Favours you honoured me with. You are well aſſured I hate you not,</hi> ſays the <hi>Queen,</hi> interrupting him: <hi>But, ſhould I believe you? Can I give you up to the ill Fate that threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens you? I ſhall never murmur againſt your</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties <hi>Orders,</hi> replies the <hi>Earl, but ſubmit to
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:60459:116"/>
them readily, whatever they be. But I confeſs, it would make me mad, ſhould my Enemies have the Advantage to condemn me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Earl of Eſſex</hi> knew the weak Side of the <hi>Queen;</hi> and eaſily reviv'd in her that Tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs he had formerly inſpir'd her with. <hi>No,</hi> ſays ſhe, having paus'd a while, <hi>you ſhall not die. Make uſe of your Advantages: triumph over a Heart, whoſe Inclinations you very well know. I will believe your Intentions leſs criminal than they appear. But, my Lord, I conjure you by that Kindneſs of which you have ſuch particular Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, that you give me no Cauſe to repent of it. Trouble not your ſelf for your Reputation and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, I will take care to repair it. And before two Days be over, I will reſtore you to the higheſt Place you ever had under me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Eſſex</hi> tranſported with Joy for the happy Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of this Conference, affected the <hi>Queen</hi> ſo much with ſubmiſſive Acknowledgments, that he reſtor'd her Spirits to perfect Tranquility. At parting, ſhe promis'd to call a <hi>Council</hi> on the Morrow, and in a glorious manner to declare him innocent.</p>
                  <p>As ſoon as it was Day, ſhe ſent for <hi>Cecil:</hi> And the Counteſs of <hi>Nottingham</hi> waited on her. Having told them in a few Words of a great Conflict paſt between her <hi>Juſtice</hi> and her <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,</hi> ſhe concluded for the latter, and ordered <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil</hi> to ſummon the <hi>Council,</hi> that ſhe might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare to them the Deſign ſhe had to ſet <hi>Eſſex</hi> at Liberty; aſſuring him ſhe had invincible Reaſons for doing ſo. This was a mortal Blow to the ambitious <hi>Cecil,</hi> and the Counteſs of <hi>Nottingham.</hi> They preſently look'd on one another, as if
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:60459:116"/>
they would have askd each others Advice what Courſe to be taken: Afterwards they ſpoke to the <hi>Queen,</hi> in hopes to divert her; but ſhe was inflexible: and <hi>Cecil</hi> was forc'd to order an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Call of the <hi>Council.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But while the <hi>Earl of Eſſex</hi>'s Enemies thought his good Fortune on the Point of being reconcil'd to him, Chance labour'd for them with unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected Succeſs.</p>
                  <p>As the <hi>Queen</hi> was going to <hi>Council,</hi> Word was brought her, the Counteſs of <hi>Rutland</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſir'd to wait on her. The <hi>Queen</hi> bluſh'd, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring what was paſs'd: And looking on the Requeſt as unſeaſonable and unlucky, ſhe was minded to have put off the <hi>Counteſs</hi> to another time: But conſidering, ſhe us'd not to deny any Perſon Acceſs, and that the Counteſs of <hi>Rutland</hi> was a Lady of the beſt Quality; ſhe command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſhe ſhould be admitted; and the <hi>Counteſs</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately came in.</p>
                  <p>Though her Eyes languiſhed, her Looks were ſad, her Dreſs and her Gate very careleſs; yet her Beauty was conſpicuous, and moving; ſhe threw her ſelf at the <hi>Queen</hi>'s Feet; and with Extremity of Grief in her Looks, <hi>Madam,</hi> ſays ſhe, with a great deal of Pain, <hi>I come to implore your</hi> Majeſties <hi>Goodneſs for the unfortunate</hi> Earl of Eſſex. <hi>For the</hi> Earl of Eſſex, <hi>Madam?</hi> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers the <hi>Queen. How come you concern'd for him, who hath quitted you with ſo much Indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, after ſo many Promiſes of extraordinary Kindneſs? I expected you were rather come to joyn your Reſentment with mine; and deſire me to take a full Revenge, for the Injury done to your Beauty. No, Madam,</hi> replyed the <hi>Counteſs, not
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:60459:117"/>
the Tranſports of a forſaken Miſtreſs, have brought me now into your Majeſties Preſence, but the tender Affection due from a virtuous Wife, to a Husband ſhe loves; in begging for the</hi> Earl of Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſex, <hi>I beg for mine. This Confeſſion may perhaps add to our Guilt; but 'tis no dallying for thoſe who are on the Brink of Deſtruction. I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, Madam, that after a thouſand Croſſes, we had that tender Kindneſs one for the other, we marryed privately, contrary to the Reſpect due to your Majeſty. This, Madam, this only, and his Fear of your</hi> Majeſties <hi>juſt Indignation, put the</hi> Earl of Eſſex <hi>upon ſeeking Refuge out of your Dominions: He thought it fit, I ſhould go out of them; but never harbour'd a Thought of conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring againſt your</hi> Majeſty. <hi>However, this hath ruin'd us; and if you protect not an unfortunate Perſon, whom you have ſo much honoured, he is irrecoverably loſt. Conſider, I beſeech you, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, that a few Drops of Blood at your Diſpoſe, and a poor Life you are Miſtreſs of, are not a Revenge ſuitable to the Grandeur of a</hi> Queen, <hi>ador'd for many Virtues; yet chiefly, for your Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Queen</hi> was ſo aſtoniſht at the Diſcourſe, that the <hi>Counteſs</hi> had full Liberty to end with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Interruption. But this was ſad News to a Heart lately full of the Delights of a pleaſing <hi>Reconciliation.</hi> What a Torrent of Anger over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowed her Conſtancy? A <hi>Queen</hi> as ſhe was, high ſpirited, haughty, and paſſionately in Love; to ſee her ſelf thus cruelly betray'd, and find it out at a time, when a blind Credulity had ſtifled all former Reſentments! Yet ſhe forced her ſelf to diſſemble her Grief; and fixing a ſevere Look
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:60459:117"/>
on the Counteſs of <hi>Eſſex: The Life you beg of me,</hi> ſays ſhe, <hi>is not in my Power: The</hi> Peers <hi>are his Judges. Ah, Madam!</hi> cryes the <hi>Counteſs, my Husband is loſt, if you give him up to their Fury: Their</hi> Jealouſie <hi>will do that which</hi> Juſtice <hi>cannot. Why ſhould: you trouble your ſelf, if he be not guilty,</hi> ſays the <hi>Queen? Though I am ſatisfy'd of his Innocence, Madam,</hi> anſwers the <hi>Counteſs, yet your cruel Miniſters are not diſpos'd to believe it. Let me intreat you, Madam, if your Majeſty will grant me no more, you will be pleas'd to allow me the Priviledge of being put into the ſame Priſon with him: I am as criminal as he, and perhaps more. I wiſh it in my Power, to grant your De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires,</hi> ſays the <hi>Queen, but common Policy forbids any Correſpondence to be allow'd between ſo conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Perſons, in your Circumſtances. You may, if you pleaſe, wait his Fate and your own, in a Chamber in this Palace. Ah, Madam,</hi> replies the Beautiful Counteſs, <hi>conſider the laſt Favour I beg of you, is, that I may be put into Irons. Can you apprehend we ſhall attempt any thing againſt you in ſo deplorable an Eſtate? This is the Eve of our greateſt Diſaſter: That Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Juſtice, to which you abſolutely commit the Care of your Vengeance, will to morrow, perhaps, part us for ever. Deny us not, at leaſt, the Comfort of mixing our laſt Tears. What can you fear from a Grief without Power— I fear being troubled with it, and I will be obey'd,</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers the angry <hi>Queen,</hi> and goes away into her Cloſet, while the Counteſs of <hi>Eſſex</hi> was carry'd to a Chamber, where ſhe was left under Guard.</p>
                  <p>Never was Fury equal to the <hi>Queen</hi>'s: The Madneſs ſhe was in to ſee her ſelf deceiv'd,
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:60459:118"/>
made her for ſome time forget all her Tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Her Thoughts were wholly bent on Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, and giving up to the Severity of Juſtice, a guilty Perſon ſhe had too paſſionately lov'd. <hi>Death,</hi> ſays ſhe, <hi>ſhall be the Reward of his Ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, and I will make his Puniſhment an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample to the Univerſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>With theſe Thoughts ſhe came to the <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil:</hi> When ſhe had declar'd her ſelf, the <hi>Peers</hi> were nam'd for trying the <hi>Earl of Eſſex</hi> and <hi>Southampton.</hi> Arm'd as ſhe was with Reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to do it, ſhe trembled at the doing; and could not forbear mixing ſome amorous Sighs with the violent Expreſſions her Anger forc'd from her. She withdrew under very great Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and admitted no Viſit for ſeveral Days.</p>
                  <p>'Tis hard to expreſs what a pleaſing Surprize it was to <hi>Cecil,</hi> to ſee the <hi>Queen</hi> angry, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare her ſelf againſt <hi>Eſſex,</hi> whom he thought her reſolv'd to pardon. He carry'd the News to the Counteſs of <hi>Nottingham;</hi> who was as joyful at it, as a cruel Perſon could be on ſuch an occaſion. Yet they could not think all ſure, while the <hi>Earl of Eſſex</hi> was only Priſoner in his Houſe, from whence his Friends (if minded to do it) might get him out. They concluded to take the Opportunity of the <hi>Queen</hi>'s Anger, to obtain her Order for putting him into the <hi>Tower of London;</hi> which <hi>Cecil,</hi> under a Cloak of Zeal for her <hi>Majeſties</hi> Service, eaſily gain'd, and readily executed. The <hi>Earl of Eſſex</hi> was generally belov'd; and <hi>Cecil,</hi> fearing Commoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Tumults if he ſhould be carryed through the City, order'd him to be ſent to the <hi>Tower</hi> by <hi>Water:</hi> Which was accordingly done.</p>

                     <pb n="215" facs="tcp:60459:118"/>The <hi>Earl of Eſſex</hi> not able to gueſs at the Cauſe of a Succeſs ſo unſuitable to the Promiſes of the <hi>Queen,</hi> prepar'd himſelf for the worſt that might happen; and in few Days, had Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution enough to bear his Misfortunes. The <hi>Queen</hi> was as full of Trouble, as <hi>Cecil</hi> and the Counteſs of <hi>Nottingham</hi> were of Hopes, to ſee their common Enemy condemn'd in few Days.</p>
                  <p>The Counteſs of <hi>Eſſex</hi> having no Comfort but her Tears, nor Company but her Fears, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd from the Pity of her Guards, to have ſome Intelligence of her Husband's Condition. She was told, <hi>His Judges were appointed, and that he was in the Tower:</hi> Worſe News ſhe could not have. The <hi>Queen</hi> was irrecoverably angry: Nor could ſhe by Letter, convey with Safety to her Husband, the Advice ſhe thought good for him. A Conference ſhe thought bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: And Money being a Charm ſeldom reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſhe did by ſome Preſents of Value prevail with her Guards to ſerve her to her Mind. Having fully poſſeſt them, ſhe neither deſign'd her own Liberty not her Husband's: All ſhe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſir'd was a Minute of private Diſcourſe with him; which her Guards undertook, and brought happily about. The Guards at the <hi>Tower,</hi> gain'd by their Companions, eaſily introduced the <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſs</hi> into her Husband's Chamber.</p>
                  <p>He knew nothing of the Paſſages at <hi>Whitehall.</hi> But when he was told, <hi>he was in few Days to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear before his Judges,</hi> he expected with a great deal of Reſolution and Conſtancy, the End of his Misfortunes; comforting himſelf with the Thoughts of the <hi>Counteſs</hi> being retir'd into <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> But ſeeing her ſo near a Danger he
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:60459:119"/>
thought her ſo remote from: <hi>Ah Madam!</hi> ſays he, with his Eyes full of Tenderneſs, <hi>What came you to look for in theſe fatal Places? And in whoſe Power was it to bring you hither? My Grief and my Guards have brought me hither:</hi> Anſwers the Counteſs. <hi>What, Madam!</hi> cryes the <hi>Earl, are you the</hi> Queen's <hi>Priſoner? And does ſhe know we are Married! Yes,</hi> reply'd the <hi>Counteſs,</hi> mournfully, <hi>and is ſo angry, we are paſt Hope. I was abſenting my ſelf from you, as you had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſir'd me, but the News of your Death ſtopt my Retreat. And it was not in my Power to betake my ſelf into a Place of Safety; there to attend the Iſſue of your Troubles: If it were not in my Power to eaſe you of them, I thought it my Duty, at leaſt to ſhare with you in them. This made me preſent my ſelf to the</hi> Queen, <hi>and omit no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that might move her Compaſſion: But ſhe prov'd altogether inflexible. Ah, Madam,</hi> ſays the Earl, interrupting her, <hi>Your Impatience hath ruin'd us; Had you not appear'd, I had been at Liberty. By a dextrous Juſtification, I had regain'd her Confidence, and you ſhould have in few Days ſeen me come in ſearch of you in</hi> Scotland. <hi>But now, there's no Hopes; the</hi> Queen <hi>will be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veng'd.

Make uſe of your Advantages, I conjure you: The</hi> Queen <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains ſome Tenderneſs for you: You may eaſily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive it. Oh! be not a Sacrifice to her Anger. Invent any thing in excuſe of our Marriage. Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>own it, if you pleaſe; I will conſent to any thing, rather than ſee you condemn'd to Death. Let her baniſh me into any Part of the World; I will go moſt willingly. And, if it may conduce to your

Safety, make uſe of the</hi> Pledge <hi>ſhe gave you</hi>—</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ah, Madam,</hi> replyes the <hi>Earl, can you give ſuch Advice to a Man, who, you know, adores you? Have you found by any of my Actions, that I love my Life more than I love you? No, I love it for nothing elſe, but to ſpend it with you: And I will part with it, with all my Heart, when I muſt be depriv'd of that Pleaſure. My Fears were only for you; and can you believe, I could have the leaſt Satisfaction in the</hi> Queen<hi>'s Favour, when her Jealouſie ſhould make her baniſh you? Let it break out, let her ruine me; I will glory in my loving you, and telling it to her Face. I know, the precious Gift ſhe beſtow'd on me, leaves me ſome Hopes; and I may make uſe of it; but I would do it with Safety, and it may prevail for more than my Life. I apprehend you,</hi> ſays the Counteſs, <hi>you would reſerve all for me, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect your own Safety: But you cannot incur a Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, wherein I have not a Share; and the way to preſerve my Life, is to ſecure yours.</hi>

                  <p>THE <hi>Queen,</hi> though angry, gave no Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der for comprehending the Counteſs of <hi>Eſſex</hi> in her Husband's Impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.

                  <p>
                     <pb n="219" facs="tcp:60459:120"/>As politick as <hi>Cecil</hi> was, he could not hide the Malignity of his intentions; but it was obſerv'd he was not only a ſevere Judge, but a dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Enemy: The Heat and Animoſity he diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd againſt the <hi>Earl of Eſſex,</hi> were anſwer'd by him with a ſlighty Reſolution, and undaunted Conſtancy. Yet, for all he could ſay in juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of himſelf, he was Condemn'd with the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malities uſual on ſuch Occaſions, Sentence was pronounc'd by the <hi>Lord High Steward,</hi> That the <hi>Earls of Eſſex</hi> and <hi>Southampton</hi> were guilty of <hi>High-Treaſon,</hi> and ſhould be Beheaded. The <hi>Earl of Eſſex</hi> was not mov'd in the leaſt, to hear himſelf nam'd, but appear'd Heartily ſorry to find the Earl of <hi>Southampton</hi> under like Condemnation; and conjur'd the Judges to examine with leſs Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity, the Conduct of a Perſon whoſe only Crime was, the Love he had for him. But not able to prevail, he melted into expreſſions of the greateſt Tenderneſs in the World, for his Friend.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Queen</hi> being inform'd of the Condition of things, gave ſecret Orders to delay Execution. She was of a High Spirit, and highly provok'd: yet found it very difficult to raiſe her Anger to a pitch equal to her Tenderneſs.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Cecil</hi> trembled to find the Execution of a Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence deferr'd, which he had with ſo much plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure heard pronounc'd. The Counteſs of <hi>Notting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> was equally alarm'd.</p>
                  <p>The Proofs were but ſlight againſt the Earl of <hi>Southampton;</hi> and the <hi>Queen,</hi> ſenſible his long Friendſhip with the <hi>Earl of Eſſex,</hi> had chiefly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd him in the Matters in Charge, pardon'd his Life at the Requeſt of his Friends.</p>
                  <p>News was brought of it to the <hi>Earl of Eſſex,</hi>
                     <pb n="220" facs="tcp:60459:121"/>
whoſe truely brave and generous Soul immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly broke forth into ſincere Proteſtations, <hi>He ſhould die now with Satisfaction and Content, ſince the</hi> Queen <hi>had own'd by her Pardon, the Innocence of</hi> Southampton.</p>
                  <p>While the <hi>Earl of Eſſex</hi> expected with a Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Conſtancy, the Cataſtrophe of his Tragedy, the <hi>Counteſs,</hi> his Wife, was inform'd at <hi>Whitehall, he was executed.</hi> Till then, ſhe believ'd it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain; but this News ſurpriz'd her ſo terribly, ſhe fill'd the whole <hi>Court</hi> with her Lamentations The <hi>Queen</hi> heard them, but was not concern'd, as the reſt were for them. <hi>Let her cry,</hi> ſays ſhe to the Counteſs of <hi>Nottingham, ſhe muſt ſhed many more, to wipe out the Score of thoſe Tears ſhe hath coſt me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Counteſs of <hi>Nottingham</hi> was ſo far from endeavouring to pacifie the <hi>Queen,</hi> that all her Care was to keep up her Anger. And becauſe ſhe was ignorant of many things ſhe thought her ſelf concern'd to know, ſhe took advantage of the trouble the Counteſs of <hi>Eſſex</hi> was in, and made her frequent Viſits; not to bemoan her afflictions, but to find out ſomething to render her more mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable. It muſt needs have been an unparallel'd Cruelty, not to pity the handſomeſt Lady on Earth, appearing to our Eyes in a Condition more deplorable than can be expreſt. She fell every minute, for very Weakneſs, into the Arms of the Women about her; and recover'd her ſelf only to lament the more pittifully: Which affected all but the Counteſs of <hi>Nottingham,</hi> who ſaw all this with an Unconcernedneſs ſuitable to the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of her Heart. <hi>Ah, Madam!</hi> ſays the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſs of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> as ſoon as ſhe ſaw her, <hi>Will you not
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:60459:121"/>
uſe your Intereſt with the</hi> Queen, <hi>in favour of the</hi> Earl of Eſſex? <hi>You know my Lord of</hi> Southampton <hi>hath his Pardon,</hi> replies ſhe, <hi>and the</hi> Queen, <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, will do as much for your Husband. Madam,</hi> ſays the Counteſs of <hi>Eſſex, 'Tis not the Crimes charg'd on my Husband, jointly with the Earl of</hi> Southampton, <hi>nor thoſe common to both, that ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the</hi> Queen <hi>inexorable: You underſtand me, when I tell you, there are others ſhe more deeply reſents. And ſhe hates the</hi> Earl of Eſſex <hi>leſs for the Attempts attributed to his Ambition, than his Engagements with me. But, Madam,</hi> replies the Counteſs of <hi>Nottingham,</hi> willing to find out the Myſtery of their Love ſhe was yet ignorant of, <hi>If you thought the</hi> Queen <hi>would oppoſe it, or be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatisfi'd with it, why did you not quit a Buſineſs wherein you were to expect nothing but Croſſes? If you were ever in Love,</hi> ſays the Counteſs of <hi>Eſſex, you know very well, we have not always our Wits about us when we are deeply engag'd in Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. However, Madam, when I Married my Lord of</hi> Eſſex, <hi>I did not know the</hi> Queen <hi>was ſo much concern'd for him. Perhaps,</hi> anſwers the Counteſs of <hi>Nottingham, I might do you ſome Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, were I throughly acquainted with the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Paſſages between my Lord of</hi> Eſſex <hi>and</hi> You. <hi>I am not in a very fit diſpoſition to diſcourſe you, Madam,</hi> ſays the Counteſs of <hi>Eſſex. But if I could by any Confidence, prevail with you to do ſomething for us, I would give you an Account of all you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire. I will not promiſe you, I ſhall certainly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail with the</hi> Queen: <hi>But, Madam,</hi> adds the cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Counteſs of <hi>Nottingham, I will uſe my Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, and perhaps, effect more than we have Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to hope for. Have a good Heart, Madam,
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:60459:122"/>
do not deſpair: The</hi> Queen <hi>is good, and I will zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly ſerve you, when I am inſtructed what courſe to take.</hi>

                  <p>The Counteſs of <hi>Eſſex</hi> yielding to the Perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of her bittereſt Enemy, dry'd up her Tears; and after a ſhort pauſe, ſpoke to this purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>MY Mother died very Young, leaving no Child but me. My Father's Offices obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging him to a conſtant Attendance at <hi>Court,</hi> he committed the care of my Infancy to a Siſter of his, ſettled about a hundred Miles from <hi>London.</hi> He could not, at thy Diſtance, ſee me ſo often as he would, ſo that when I came to Fourteen Years of Age, he thought, by diſpoſing me in Marriage, to bring me nearer him.</p>
                  <p>The Earl of <hi>Rutland</hi> had but one Son; and the intimate Friendſhip between my Father and him, induc'd them to think of a ſtricter Alliance. Our Fortunes were equal; and the Earl of <hi>Rut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>'s Son being Return'd out of <hi>Italy,</hi> his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther acquainted him with his Deſign of Marry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him. His Affection was no way engag'd to the contrary: And the Buſineſs was agreed on without my Knowledge, who was look'd upon as too Young to be Conſulted with, in a Cauſe of that Nature. Yet, Madam, my Heart was ſenſible ſo early, and capable of Diſcerning be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Perſon and Perſon; and made it appear by Experience, <hi>Obedience</hi> and <hi>Affection</hi> do no not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways agree.</p>
                  <p>The Equipage of the Young Gentleman was no ſooner ready, but he came where I was. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not in Love, nor expecting much Pleaſure in waiting on a Miſtreſs he had never ſeen, and was
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:60459:122"/>
repreſented to him as a Child, he pray'd Three of his Friends to Honour his Nuptails with there Preſence: The <hi>Earl of Eſſex</hi> was one of them. When they arriv'd, my Looks were divided be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween ſeveral Men, all much of one Age, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually unknown to me. I know well enough, the Earl of <hi>Rutland</hi>'s Son ws deſign'd my Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band; and I preſently wiſh'd he were the Man whom I afterwads knew to be the <hi>Earl of Eſſex;</hi> at the firſt ſight of whom, all my Trouble for being Marry'd ſo Young, was preſently over. He was the Firſt ſpoke to me and look'd on me more earneſtly than any of the others. This made me believe it was as I wiſh'd. But I was ſadly undeceiv'd, when the Young Earl of <hi>Rutland</hi> was preſented to me. I Bluſh'd and Sigh'd, not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Cauſe. The Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> did alſo the like; his Eyes went ſtill in ſearch of me; and I was not reſerv'd enough to avoid them. The trouble I appear'd in was attributed to the Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence of my Age; and I quickly learnt to take care to hide it.</p>
                  <p>Our Parents being arriv'd, we were Marry'd, without being ask'd by them, If we were willing. The Earl of <hi>Rutland</hi>'s Son appear'd pleas'd with his Fortune; and perhaps, found me more amia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble than he expected. I, Madam, was ſo in Love with the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> all I could do, was not to hate my Husband. Yet I had the good luck, my Kindneſs for my Lord of <hi>Eſſex</hi> was not ſo much as ſuſpected.</p>
                  <p>'Twas believ'd I was then ſenſible of no other Pleaſures, but what Children delight in; but no Age is a ſtranger to Love. I quickly knew what it was to have a Kindneſs; and ſoon complain'd
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:60459:123"/>
the Liberty of my Inclination had been uſurp'd upon. I had little joy in being ſo far Miſtreſs of my ſelf, as to wiſh I could love my Husband, and endeavour it; and to have an indifference for the Earl of <hi>Eſſex;</hi> for all my Efforts to that purpoſe were vain.</p>
                  <p>The firſt Reſolution I took, was to avoid the ſight of a Man, who could only contribute to make me more unhappy. And when he had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken his leave with the reſt of my Lord of <hi>Rut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>'s Friends, I pray'd my Father to ſpare my Youth for ſome time, and not to expoſe me ſo ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the <hi>Court,</hi> where I never had been. My Deſire was granted; and when my Father return'd for <hi>London,</hi> to ſatisfie me, they took me to <hi>Rut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But the Courſe I took, produc'd not the Effect I propos'd: The <hi>Idea</hi> of the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied me, in my Solitude. And my Father-in-Law being dead, we were forc'd to go to <hi>London,</hi> after a Years ſtay in the Country.</p>
                  <p>I trembled to think, I ſhould ſee the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> again; and reſolv'd with my ſelf, I would be the moſt retir'd Perſon on Earth, to avoid all Occaſions of meeting him; when News was brought me, he was gone with the Earl of <hi>Lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter</hi> into the <hi>Low-Countries.</hi> The <hi>Queen</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd me with that Kindneſs ſhe uſually expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to thoſe ſhe intends to Honour. I admir'd her Merit; and the Pleaſure to ſee my ſelf reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by her, ſuſpended a while my ſecret inquietudes.</p>
                  <p>But within leſs than half a Year, my Father died, and ſoon after my Husband. I was much afflicted at theſe loſſes: I bewail'd my Father's Death a long time: And if I had not for my Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:60459:123"/>
that great Kindneſs, which is rarely met with in Marriages of Obedience, my Reaſon, and his Complaiſance had forc'd me to eſteem him, and to expreſs Acknowledgments ſincere enough, to ſave me the Trouble of any juſt Reproach from my ſelf, or any other.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Queen</hi> having told me, ſhe deſir'd to have me near her, I quitted my Houſe for an Apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in this Palace, and my Fortune, which was very conſiderable, gave me ſuch Charms, as drew about me a number of Suitors, who pretended mighty Kindneſs for me; but were really rather a Trouble, than Pleaſure to me.</p>
                  <p>In this condition was I, when the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> returned to <hi>London.</hi> The <hi>Queen</hi>'s Army had been Victorious; and ſhe order'd a publick Thankſgiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, when the Generals arriv'd. I waited on her to St. <hi>Pauls;</hi> and had not the Power by any Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, to be ſo reſerv'd, as not ſingle out from all the Nobility of the Kingdom, the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> alone, to fix my Eyes on.</p>
                  <p>The morrow, he was one of the firſt to wait on the <hi>Queen:</hi> I was with her before. I was mov'd at the ſight of him: we looked on one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother ſeveral times, with equal Concern. <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> ſaid he, as ſoon as he could ſpeak to me, <hi>I have not had a moments liberty to ſignifie to you, how great a ſhare I bear in your Loſſes. I believe,</hi> anſwered I, <hi>you are ſorry for my Misfortune. 'Tis natural for every one to be concern'd for ſuch a Perſon as you are,</hi> adds he: <hi>But, Madam, I am much more concern'd than any other.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Queen</hi> interrupted us: But in all the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> paid her, I would not but obſerve his Eye was towards me. I confeſs,
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:60459:124"/>
I was glad to ſee him ſo eager; and perhaps, I anſwered him a little too ſoon; but I was young, tender, and Independent. His Merits were then extraordinary; and he had the advantage of my firſt inclination.</p>
                  <p>He came the ſame day to ſee me in my Apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and fail'd not to do it conſtantly after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. All his Actions perſwaded me, at length that he lov'd me; and it was not long, e're he let me know it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Madam,</hi> ſaid he, one Evening, having brought me to my Chamber, after I had left the <hi>Queen, Do you remember the time we accompany'd the Earl of</hi> Rutland <hi>to your Country-Houſe? I have not forgot, Sir,</hi> anſwered I, <hi>that you were one of them that did him that Honour. Is that all you remember of it?</hi> adds he. <hi>Did you obſerve nothing in my Eyes worthy taking notice of? And was it poſſible, you ſhould inſpire into me ſo much Love, without feeling the Power of it in your ſelf? The Friendſhip I had for the Earl of</hi> Rutland, <hi>and the Progreſs he had made, prevented my ſpeaking of it. Yet Time and Abſence have but increas'd my Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. And I proteſt ſincerely, from the firſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment I ſaw you, my Heart was never affected with any but your ſelf.</hi>

                  <p>A Diſcourſe of this nature, may perhaps be thought unſuitable to the Condition I was then in; who Mourn'd for a <hi>Father</hi> and a <hi>Husband:</hi> Yet I had not the Power to be offended with it. The Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> aſſur'd me, I had gain'd his Affection: I was willing to gain his, and I car'd for no more.</p>
                  <p>You will give me leave, Madam, to paſs over my Anſwers; and tell you only, the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi>
                     <pb n="227" facs="tcp:60459:124"/>
was very well ſatisfied with them; that we then ſettled the Correſpondence we have ſo long main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd; and that we found Occaſions, and Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities to poliſh and perfect it.</p>
                  <p>Thus far you ſee me ignorant of the <hi>Queen</hi>'s Inclinations: I, as well as others, attributed the Favour we ſaw the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> was in, to his Services, and his Dexterity in ſetting them out to advantage. But in time, I perceived my mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake: And as reſerv'd as the <hi>Queen</hi> was, found out the Myſtery, and tremble at the Diſcovery.</p>
                  <p>The Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> had an elevated <hi>Soul,</hi> and capable of Greatneſs, Ambition might rob me of him; and I was willing to fortifie my ſelf againſt all Misfortunes, and to reſerve only an Eſteem for him. But what hopes of doing that now, which all my reaſon, and two Years Marriage had not effected?</p>
                  <p>At laſt, Jealouſie ſucceeded my Fears; and I began to believe, the reſpect the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> had for the <hi>Queen,</hi> might proceed from a ſecret Affection. I fretted at this, and grieved at the Heart: The Earl perceived it, and ſollicited me long to tell him the Cauſe. I refus'd as long as I was able. <hi>I am Jealous,</hi> ſaid I to him at laſt, with a little Heat, <hi>and afraid I ſhould loſe your Affection. 'Tis not an Unhappineſs,</hi> anſwers he, <hi>to ſee you love me ſo, as to doubt of me: But there is no Cauſe to queſtion my Faithfulneſs, who never lov'd any but you. The</hi> Queen <hi>loves you,</hi> ſaid I; <hi>and her Kindneſs for you, with the Advantage of her Grandeur, may be dangerous Temptations to your Perſeverance. The</hi> Queen <hi>love me, Madam!</hi> Replies he, <hi>How you interpret her ordinary Boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which hath (perhaps) too generouſly recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penc'd
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:60459:125"/>
my Services beyond their Merit? She is too Haughty, and too Great a Miſtreſs of her ſelf, to fall into ſuch a Weakneſs. You know, what Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious Alliances ſhe hath ſlighted; and are to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, ſhe is above the reach of Love. There is not a</hi> Monarch <hi>on Earth, but I would prefer you before him,</hi> anſwer'd I; <hi>and meaſuring the</hi> Queen<hi>'s Affection by mine, I am eaſily perſuaded, ſhe may do ſo too, her Eye is always upon you, ſpite of all her Precautions, and is never elſe ſatisfied; and I have obſerved ſome Sighs from her, which a Heart concern'd as mine, cannot hear without Trouble. I did not till now know how happy I was,</hi> ſays the Earl of <hi>Eſſex; but your Jealouſie makes me ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of it. Yet, Madam, give me leave to aſſure you, you have no Cauſe for it. Were the</hi> Queen <hi>Weak, as you Imagine; did ſhe offer me her Crown and her Kindneſs; I would, by my Refuſal, let you ſee, though I have Ambition, my Love for you infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely exceeds it. To ſatisfie you of your Miſtake, allow me to procure her Conſent to our Marriage. You have mourn'd long enough, to avoid all impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of Indecency: It is in your Power to make me the happieſt of Men, and to clear all the doubts you have of my Faithfulneſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I was far from oppoſing the Propoſal he made; and I was not fully convinc'd the <hi>Queen</hi> was in Love with him, yet, I thought, if ſhe was, he knew it not.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>To let you ſee,</hi> adds he, <hi>I will not conceal from you any Kindneſs the</hi> Queen <hi>hath expreſt for me; I declare, I Sacrifice to you, one of the handſomeſt Ladies of the</hi> Court, <hi>who hath a thouſand ways in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited my Love.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I preſt him to let me know her Name; but he
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:60459:125"/>
conjur'd me to be ſatisfy'd with what he had ſaid; and, not to force him to further Indiſcretion, I gave over Preſſing him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>[The Counteſs of <hi>Nottingham</hi> Bluſh'd at this Part of the Diſcourſe, having Reaſon to believe her ſelf the Perſon intended. She Hated him the more for't; but had the Command of her ſelf, not to interrupt the Counteſs of <hi>Eſſex;</hi> who proceeded in her Story.]</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>This freedom of the Earl put an end to my ſuſpicions. I left him to take his Time for ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the <hi>Queen:</hi> When he went to thank her for the Government of <hi>Ireland</hi> beſtow'd on him, he return'd to me with a Tranſport of Joy, to tell me; <hi>The</hi> Queen <hi>had not only Conſented to his Deſires, but intented to make the Earl of</hi> Leice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>King of</hi> England. This quieted my Spirit, and made me acknowledge, I had no cauſe to be Jealous.</p>
                  <p>We ſpent ſome days with a great deal of Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; but were Cruelly interrupted by the Order the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> received to go into <hi>France,</hi> to command the Forces the <hi>Queen</hi> ſent in aid of that <hi>King.</hi> I had not time to expreſs my Grief to him, or to be a Witneſs of his. We parted in haſte: and then it was, I repented I had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd him; and that the <hi>Queen</hi>'s Coldneſs towards me, convinc'd me of the Truth of my former Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicions; and that her ſending away the Earl of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> was but to remove him from me.</p>
                  <p>I left Court, as ſoon as I could, with Decen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, ask the <hi>Queen</hi> leave to retire into a Houſe of my Fathers, about Fifty Miles from <hi>London.</hi> I will not tell you how I was Alarm'd at the News of the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> his Death in his Return from
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:60459:126"/>
                     <hi>Spain;</hi> nor how we Writ to one another, in his abſence. I was ready to Dye for Grief, when he arriv'd at my Houſe, more Reſpectful and more Amorous than he had ever appear'd.</p>
                  <p>He would have put me out of my Opinion, concerning the <hi>Queen:</hi> But I obſtinately main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd it True. When I had convinc'd him of it, he offer'd to leave <hi>England,</hi> if I would name a Place where he might Live quietly. I had Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection enough to incline me to Conſent to this Propoſal: But conſidering it Unjuſt in me to ſpoil the Progreſs of his good Fortune, and put an end to his hopes, by an Unexcuſable Retreat, I told him, it was impoſſible. And uſhering with a Sigh the Advice I was going to give him: <hi>Forget me, Sir,</hi> ſaid I, <hi>for I ſee your Fate will force you to it. The</hi> Queen <hi>will ſtill croſs us, and never want Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence to Seperate us: 'Tis better breaking off an Engagement, that ſuits not with your Affairs; No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the World, can be a greater Misfortune to me; but I will ſubmit to it, if it be for your Good. You ſuſpect me of indifference</hi> (ſaid he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupting me;) <hi>and you have the Cruelty to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe me to it. Did you love me more, you would know me better: And were I capable of doing an unjuſt thing, I believe you would Exhort me to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get you, for no other cauſe but that you might think of me no more. But, Madam, to ſhorten our Diſcourſe, and our Doubts, which almoſt make me Mad, Believe it, I love you above all things in the World, there is a ſure and eaſie way to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie you of it. You are not willing to go with me out of</hi> England; <hi>and yet you are ſtill afraid of the</hi> Queen: <hi>Let us Marry privately, and conceal it till we ſee a more favourable Time. This will
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:60459:126"/>
fruſtrate the Queen's deſign to our Prejudice; you will no longer doubt of my Affection: And if the buſineſs be diſcover'd, 'tis but flying out of the Reach of the Reſentments we fear.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I was ſtrangely mov'd at this Diſcourſe: E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing oblig'd me to believe him. Yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering it would reflect upon my Reputation to be privately Married, I was afraid to conſent. The Earl Complained of me; I Cry'd: Love was our Arbitratour, and decided the Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie in his Favour. After long reſiſtance, I agreed to a private Marriage; on Condition the Earl would go for <hi>London</hi> on the Morrow; and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear diſ-engagag'd to the <hi>Queen</hi> from all the Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs he had had from me. We agreed to be Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried at the Earl of <hi>Southampton</hi>'s, his particular Friend; where I was to ſtay, while he went for <hi>London.</hi> Thus we parted: He took <hi>London</hi> Road; I went for <hi>Southampton,</hi> attended by <hi>Tracy,</hi> a Domeſtick of the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi>'s, in whom he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd an entire Confidence.</p>
                  <p>As the Earl was on the Road, he had leiſure to conſider what Meaſures to take. My Lord <hi>Southampton</hi> came to receive me at his Houſe; where the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> arriv'd, ſoon after he had obtain'd leave from the <hi>Queen,</hi> to Abſent him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a few Days.</p>
                  <p>We are now come to the Inſtant that uſher'd in our Croſſes. We were Marry'd in the Preſence of my Lord <hi>Southampton, Tracy,</hi> and ſome Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of mine, and a Kinſman of the Earl of <hi>Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſex.</hi> He gave me an Account how the <hi>Queen</hi> had receiv'd him; and began to confeſs, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd ſhe lov'd him.</p>
                  <p>He ſtay'd but ſix Days at <hi>Southampton;</hi> in which time we agreed what courſe to take.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="232" facs="tcp:60459:127"/>I was too far from <hi>London</hi> to ſee the Earl of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten without diſcovering our Correſpondence. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſeem'd more proper to Conceal it, than a Houſe he had within few Miles of <hi>London,</hi> on the <hi>Thames</hi> ſide: It ſtood alone, and was ſtrong enough to prevent a Surpriſe. Having ſettled my Affairs, I was conducted thither by my Lord <hi>Southampton</hi> and <hi>Tracy,</hi> while the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> return'd for <hi>London.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Nothing could be more pleaſant, than the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude I was in. My Lord of <hi>Eſſex</hi> came to ſee me every Day: And I ſpent there two Years, without a moments Trouble. At laſt, an Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent happen'd that miſerably perplext us.</p>
                  <p>The Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> had an infinite of Enemies, who envy'd him; and for all his Caution, they took notice of his extraordinary Aſſiduity for the Place I was in. They told the Queen of it: She was diſturb'd at it; more perhaps, for the Suſpicion ſhe had of ſome Private Gallantry of his there, than for thoſe matters they would have poſſeſt her with.</p>
                  <p>I gave her no Trouble: The Earl's Diſengage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, with my pretended Journey into <hi>France,</hi> had ſecur'd her as to me. Yet ſhe would go ſee whether the Earl frequented that Houſe, only for the Pleaſure of the Place, or ſome hidden Cauſe.</p>
                  <p>One Day, as the Earl was with her, ſhe gave Orders, her ordinary Retinue ſhould be ready to wait on her. <hi>I have long had a mind to ſee your Country-Houſe,</hi> ſays ſhe to the Earl, <hi>I have had a very pleaſant Deſcription of it: The Weather is fair; and I believe a Walk ſo far may do me good.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>You may imagine the Fears this put the Earl
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:60459:127"/>
in: He durſt not openly oppoſe her Deſign; but endeavoured to divert her, by ſaying, <hi>His Houſe deſerv'd not the Pains it would coſt her, to go ſo far.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When he ſaw her reſolv'd upon it, he begg'd leave to go before, to put things in order for her Reception. <hi>Nay,</hi> ſays ſhe, <hi>you ſhall be my Guide: There's no need of Preparation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Earl, at theſe Words trembled for me. He was depriv'd of all means of Precaution; and the Concern he appear'd in, made the Queen more curious.</p>
                  <p>Imagine what a Trouble he was in by the way, and how often he wiſh'd ſomething might hinder their Arrival. But Fortune favour'd the Queen's Deſigns ſo far, that they came ſafe to the Houſe; and ſhe would preſently go ſee the Lodgings. The Earl aſtoniſh'd, gave her his Hand. The Chamber I us'd, was the beſt in the Houſe; and the firſt the Queen ſtaid at. The Earl ſeeing no Remedy, ſteps to the Door, which he found o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen contrary to Cuſtom, and was pleaſingly ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd, to find only <hi>Tracy</hi> there, ſleeping, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther pretending to ſleep on a Couch. He was quickly awak'd; and having expreſs'd his Surprize and Reſpect, immediately withdrew.</p>
                  <p>The Earl of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> who thought him at <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> began to take Heart, fancying his good <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> had revealed the Adventure to <hi>Tracy.</hi> But a new Trouble aroſe: My Picture hung in the ſame Room, under a Curtain. The <hi>Queen</hi> ask'd <hi>If it was the</hi> Earl's? He anſwered, with ſome Trouble, <hi>It was not.</hi> The <hi>Queen</hi> drew the Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and ſaw her ſelf drawn at length, where the Earl thought my Picture would appear. Then
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:60459:128"/>
it was he was perſwaded, the faithful <hi>Tracy</hi> had had an Intimation of the Journey.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Queen</hi> expreſs'd much Joy, to ſee her Pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in the Earl's Chamber.</p>
                  <p>From the Houſe, ſhe went into the Garden; took a ſhort Repaſt, during which, <hi>Tracy</hi> found the opportunity to whiſper the Earl, <hi>He need not trouble himſelf</hi>—and return'd to <hi>London,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the leaſt ſuſpicion.</p>
                  <p>Thus Matters paſs'd on their ſide. As to ours, The very inſtant the <hi>Queen</hi> told the Earl of <hi>Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſex, ſhe would ſee his Houſe,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Southamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> was at her Chamber-Door. <hi>You are come in very good time, to go along with the</hi> Queen <hi>to the Earl of</hi> Eſſex<hi>'s,</hi> ſays the Officer, who was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to provide the Equipage.</p>
                  <p>The Earl of <hi>Southampton</hi> by theſe few Words, quickly diſcover'd the Storm that threatned his Friend: And to provide a Remedy; <hi>I am not ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well,</hi> ſaid he to the Officer: <hi>Perhaps the</hi> Queen <hi>may command me to wait on her; I will not go into her Preſence. Pray, let her not know you have ſeen me.</hi> The Officer promis'd, <hi>ſhe ſhould not;</hi> and <hi>Southampton</hi> haſtened to the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi>'s, to tell <hi>Tracy;</hi> who immediately took the beſt Horſe his Maſter had; and put him ſo well to it, that he was with me before the <hi>Queen</hi> left <hi>London.</hi> I was not a little trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled at the News. <hi>Tracy</hi> hid me, and my Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in a Quarter, where was no likelyhood of our being diſcover'd; and then chang'd the <hi>Queen</hi>'s Picture for mine.</p>
                  <p>That Evening, the Earl of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> came to ſee me, and gave me an Account of the Tortures he had that Day endur'd for me; and how <hi>Sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thampton</hi>
                     <pb n="235" facs="tcp:60459:128"/>
and <hi>Tracy</hi> had deliver'd him out of them.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Iriſh</hi> rebell'd; I lay in at that time: The Earl of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> who lov'd me no leſs than his Glory, had within himſelf deſperate Conflicts. His Duty prevail'd: He deſir'd he might com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the Army, the <hi>Queen</hi> granted it; and the ſame time, plainly delar'd her Affection for him; which I was before but too well aſſur'd of. She gave him abundance of very kind Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions; and (to confirm the Truth of them) a RING, which ſtill leaves the poor Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> ſome Hopes.</p>
                  <p>He was ſufficiently prepar'd to manage the <hi>Queen:</hi> And you ſee, by this time, Madam, whether he was not under a neceſſity of ſome Diſſimulation.</p>
                  <p>He gave me a faithful Account of all paſs'd between them; and being fearful for me in his Abſence, he reſolv'd to remove me, and to go himſelf out of <hi>England,</hi> if matters were diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd.</p>
                  <p>This put him in ſearch of ſome Places of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge. The King of <hi>Scots</hi> promis'd him, among others, the Palace of <hi>Dimbourg.</hi> The Earl of <hi>Tyrone</hi> made him many Propoſals; but certain it is, he never hearkened to any of them.</p>
                  <p>I was weak when he left me, and oblig'd to recover a little Strength, before I would under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take a Voyage for <hi>Scotland.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I was on my way, Fortune ſtay'd me, the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> was charg'd with ſeveral Matters; and the <hi>Queen</hi> prepoſſeſt by our Enemies, took our innocent Precautions for Crimes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="236" facs="tcp:60459:129"/>At laſt, Madam, the Earl was forc'd to come and ſhut himſelf up in the Place where I was; and was reſolv'd to periſh in Defence of me.</p>
                  <p>You know what follow'd. Conſider the Frights I was in, amidſt ſo much Trouble and Blood, I ſaw every day ſpilt.</p>
                  <p>The Earl conjur'd me inceſſantly, to quit a Place where he could not make any long De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence againſt ſo many Forces, as were imploy'd to take it.</p>
                  <p>I exhorted him to yield, and implore the <hi>Queen</hi>'s Goodneſs. He proteſted, <hi>He would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver do it, till I was in a Place of Safety.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus was I forc'd to leave him, and go for <hi>Dimbourgh.</hi> The faithful <hi>Tracy,</hi> who ſhould have conducted me thither, had periſh'd alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, in maintaining the Intereſts of his Maſter.</p>
                  <p>The Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> committed me to the Charge of one of his Kinſmen; they forc'd me out of his Arms, to put me aboard a Boat that waited for us on the <hi>Thames,</hi> and was to carry us to the Place where our Convoy attended us.</p>
                  <p>My Fears, and my Grief put me into a Fever: This ſtaid me ſome Days, at a little Village, where I had News of the Earl's Impriſonment, and the <hi>Queen</hi>'s Reſolution to ruine him.</p>
                  <p>The Extremity of my Deſpair, put me on the Reſolution of preſenting my ſelf to the <hi>Queen,</hi> and endeavouring to obtain ſome Favour by an ingenuous Confeſſion. But, Madam, you know I found in her no Diſpoſition to pardon us.</p>
                  <p>My Conduct hath produc'd a terrible Effect: And I may juſtly reproach my ſelf, to have been the Cauſe of all my Lord <hi>Eſſex</hi> his Misfortunes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="237" facs="tcp:60459:129"/>This Diſcourſe ended in Tears. The Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſs of <hi>Nottingham</hi> took ſmall care to ſtop them: She was too much concern'd in more than one Part of the Story, which heightened her Fury: And leaving the Counteſs of <hi>Eſſex</hi> to the Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of Deſpair, ſhe return'd to the <hi>Queen,</hi> whom ſhe found almoſt drown'd in hers. She us'd all her Art to revive the <hi>Queen</hi>'s Anger; and by her cruel Addreſs, effected her Deſign; without ſaying a Word directly againſt the Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Cecil</hi> and ſhe were tormented to ſee the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution delay'd.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>What ſhall we do, Madam,</hi> ſays he to her, <hi>if the Queen, in the Heighth of her Anger, will not give way that Juſtice be done? What are we to expect when her Anger is over? What are we not to fear from her Love, if it once get the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of a Heart as hers is? 'Tis no where ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perious, no where ſo abſolute; and I very much doubt, whether all our Caution can prevent the ill Effects of it. In a Word, condemn'd as the</hi> Earl of Eſſex <hi>is, by an Auguſt Aſſembly, 'tis poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, he may recover his former Favour with the</hi> Queen, <hi>and utterly ruin us, as ſoon as he ſets Footing at</hi> Court. <hi>I ſhall beſtir my ſelf a little, ere that come to paſs,</hi> (ſays the Counteſs of <hi>Nottingham;) I have the</hi> Queen<hi>'s Ear: I know how to ſpeak; I am not ſuſpected; nor am I a Stranger to the Secrets of the one, nor the other: Yet we are not to flatter our ſelves; the</hi> Earl of Eſſex <hi>is Maſter of his Fortune. If he petition, the</hi> Queen <hi>will not have the Power to deny him. He hath a</hi> Pledge, <hi>which gives him an obſolute Power over her: But, thanks to his Pride, he
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:60459:130"/>
will not make uſe of it. Beſides, whom can be employ in an Affair of this Nature, but we can corrupt? I will not leave the</hi> Queen, <hi>and I'll pawn my Life, I will ſecure all with her. Do your part, and let's not be ſurpriz'd.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Cecil</hi> knew the Counteſs <hi>Nottingham</hi> too well to doubt of what ſhe ſaid: He parted better ſatisfy'd; and thought of nothing but what flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd their common Hatred againſt <hi>Eſſex.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Queen</hi> had had a very ill Night, torment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed equally with Sickneſs and Trouble. She con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered the Unfaithfulneſs of the Earl of <hi>Eſſex;</hi> his plotting againſt her Authority, his private Marriage, his giving himſelf wholly up to the Pleaſures of it, while he pretended to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely at her Devotion, and his Pride in the Depth of Misfortunes.</p>
                  <p>She thought ſometimes theſe Reflections ſtrong enough, to enable her to ſee him dye.</p>
                  <p>But preſently, the pleaſant <hi>Idea</hi> of him ſhe would deſtroy, his Merit, his Services, and the natural Inclinations ſhe had for him, inſpir'd her again with gentle Reſolutions. She thought it better to ſee him a Criminal, than never to ſee him more. The Thoughts of his Execution put her almoſt beſides her ſelf, though it was in her Power to prevent it.</p>
                  <p>The Counteſs of <hi>Nottingham</hi> was as wakeful as the <hi>Queen,</hi> though for different Reaſons; and waiting on her in the Morning, as uſual, <hi>You find me in a lamentable Condition,</hi> ſays the <hi>Queen; and if you help not to comfort me, I ſhall not be able to endure it much longer. The Wretch who cauſes me all this Trouble, is always before my Eyes, in the moſt pitiful Condition imaginable. It
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:60459:130"/>
is poſſible, I ſhould do nothing for him in ſuch an Extremity? Shall I permit him to periſh, as if I had no more valu'd him than another; when I have declar'd to him I lov'd him? Shall I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach my ſelf one Day with Cruelty, to have forſaken him, when it was in my Power to ſave him? What your Majeſty ſhall be pleas'd to do in his Favour,</hi> replies the Counteſs of <hi>Nottingham, will be the more generous, for that he hath not ſollicited it. If he petition'd, your Bounty would be look'd upon as an Effect of your Pity, and his Submiſſions: But now, it will proceed purely from your Goodneſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe Words effected partly what ſhe aim'd at. The <hi>Queen</hi> bluſh'd, ſigh'd, and was ſilent a while.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>It muſt be confeſt</hi> (proceeds ſhe) <hi>That to do all for him, without putting him to the coſt of one Sign of Repentance, is to approve of his Pride, and encourage him to carry it on to the higheſt Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities. He would have my Kindneſs do all; and without any Reflection on the Outrages he hath done me, he believes, I ſhall think my ſelf too happy in beholding the Executioner's Hand. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver doubt, Madam,</hi> (ſays the Counteſs) <hi>but he makes account to triumph ſtill over that Goodneſs your Majeſty hath always made appear towards him. Had he been carried from</hi> Weſtminſter <hi>to the Scaffold; had you given him a Sight of that Sence of Death, and pardon'd</hi> Southampton, <hi>without reſpiting the other's Execution, he would have been glad to make uſe of any means, in his Power, to move you to Mercy. But he knows the Power he hath over you; and pretends that by receiving a Pardon he vouchſafes not to Petition
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:60459:131"/>
for, all the World will believe him innocent. But, Madam, if matters be carried on thus, What will the World judge of your Majeſty? There is not a Perſon ignorant of this Adventure: And if the</hi> Earl of Eſſex, <hi>without acknowledging his Crimes, ſees himſelf at Liberty: Will it not be ſaid, That</hi> England <hi>is govern'd by a</hi> Queen, <hi>not ſo diſcreet as Fame reports her to be?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>At this, <hi>Cecil</hi> arriv'd and fortify'd extreamly the Counteſs of <hi>Nottingham</hi>'s Parly: He ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her with all the Art of a cruel Eloquence, to perſwade the <hi>Queen, She was concern'd in Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, the</hi> Earl of Eſſex <hi>ſhould die.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Queen,</hi> in a Pet, conſented he ſhould be executed ſuddenly; and <hi>Cecil</hi> loſt no time in car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying her Orders to thoſe who were to be Actors in the Execution.</p>
                  <p>The Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> (as the Counteſs of <hi>Notting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> had ſhrewdly gueſs'd) had no Thoughts of petitioning for a Favour, which, in all Probability, the <hi>Queen</hi>'s Kindneſs would of it ſelf freely grant him. But when he ſaw himſelf on the point of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing carry'd to the Place of Execution, he thought it his Duty, not to neglect the Medicines he had in his power, to bring about the <hi>Queen.</hi> Then he reſolv'd to implore Her Mercy, and put her in mind of her Promiſes and Oaths. And knowing the Counteſs of <hi>Nottingham</hi> was her Favorite and Confident; though he had Cauſe to believe, ſhe had no great Kindneſs for him, he was perſwaded, ſhe might have Generoſity enough, to ſerve him in this important Meditation.</p>
                  <p>He ſent to deſire the Favour of a Viſit from her. The Counteſs, impatient to know the Cauſe, went directly to him, without acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the <hi>Queen.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="241" facs="tcp:60459:131"/>Who, but a <hi>Barbarian,</hi> could have ſeen the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi>'s Perſon, and at the ſame time know his Misfortune, without being melted into Compaſſion? Yet the Counteſs of <hi>Nottingham,</hi> at the ſight of him, was all Cruelty and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge; But, feigning ſome ſweetneſs, ſhe gave him away to declare himſelf thus.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Can you, Madam, pardon the moſt unfortunate of Men, the Trouble he gives you, at a time when he hath no cauſe to flatter himſelf you have any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains of Kindneſs for him? Yet nothing can be now of greater Advantage to me, than your Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection. I know the Power you have over the</hi> Queen; <hi>and would you be pleas'd to joyn it to my Sorrow and Repentance, for having offended Her, I doubt not, but we may prevail much. Tell Her then, Madam,</hi> continues he, (putting his Knee to the Ground) <hi>That you have ſeen me in this ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliant Poſture, full of Grief for having deſerv'd Her Hatred. Reſtore her this</hi> RING, <hi>which I have kept; and entreat Her to remember the Promiſes She made when She gave it me. I beg my Life by this</hi> PLEDGE, <hi>and She cannot deny it me, without forgeting Her Oaths. I can no longer look on Life, as a thing pleaſing to me; but a miſerable Wife, and the Intereſt of a Son preſs me to continue it as long as I can. I cannot think, the Innocence of the One, or the Infancy of the Other, needs my Juſtification: The Favour to be begg'd of the</hi> Queen, <hi>is for me alone.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Counteſs of <hi>Nottingham</hi> was tranſported with Joy, to ſee the <hi>Earl</hi> truſt her with the RING, which had ſo often Alarm'd her, and whoſe Power <hi>Cecil</hi> was ſtill afraid of. She frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly promis'd what ſhe had not the leaſt intent to
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:60459:132"/>
do for <hi>Eſſex,</hi> added feign'd Tears to her falſe Promiſes, and aſſur'd him, ſhe would directly go uſe her utmoſt Intereſt with the <hi>Queen,</hi> in his Favour.</p>
                  <p>But inſtead of going to the <hi>Queen,</hi> to give Her an Acccunt of her Viſit, ſhe went to <hi>Cecil;</hi> who waited for her, prais'd her Cruelty, and had the Pleaſure to ſee in his power, the ſole Obſtacle againſt <hi>Eſſex</hi>'s Death.</p>
                  <p>They went together to the <hi>Queen,</hi> who asking, <hi>How</hi> Eſſex <hi>receiv'd Her laſt Orders?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>He was never obſerv'd ſo haughty, Madam,</hi> (anſwer's <hi>Cecil;) he cannot prevail with himſelf to ſhew the leaſt Sign of Repentance. He thinks of nothing but his Wife, and ſhe is the whole Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of his diſcourſe to thoſe who go to him. Let him die then, let him periſh,</hi> (ſays the <hi>Queen,</hi> ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry angry) <hi>ſince he will have it ſo. Let Me be eas'd of the tormenting Uncertainties and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiets I am under. I am no longer againſt his Execution.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Zealous Miniſter was unwilling to leave the <hi>Queen</hi> the leaſt time of Reflection: And while the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> was in expectation of the Effect of the Promiſes of the unfaithful Counteſs of <hi>Nottingham,</hi> proviſion was made for his Execution in the <hi>Tower,</hi> to avoid a Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion among the People, who lov'd him.</p>
                  <p>His Soul was naturally great, and diſcover'd not the leaſt Weakneſs, in the laſt extremity.</p>
                  <p>Never did Man go to his Death with more Conſtancy and Firmneſs. He did not murmur in the leaſt, againſt the <hi>Queen;</hi> though he might have Reproacht her with Promiſes. He moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the <hi>Scaffold</hi> Reſolutely, Undreſt himſelf, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:60459:132"/>
his Family to thoſe about him; and having drawn Tears from all Eyes that were Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctators of that laſt Act of his Life, he receiv'd his Death, without ſo much as giving way his Eyes ſhould be cover'd.</p>
                  <p>Thus Dy'd this famous Favourite of Queen <hi>Elizabeth.</hi> One of the beſt Qualify'd Perſons in the World; and a Man who had been too hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, had not Love had too great a Power over him.</p>
                  <p>Soon after the Queen had conſented he ſhould be Executed, ſhe Relaps'd into her former irreſolutions; and after a ſharp Conflict within her ſelf, ſhe reſolv'd to Pardon him; and ſent an Officer of her Guards, to forbid their proceeding further: But it was too late: <hi>Cecil</hi> had fore-ſeen what might happen, and cruelly provided againſt the Effects of her relapſe into former Kindneſs. The Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> was already Executed; and that was the Anſwer he carry'd the <hi>Queen.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then it was ſhe loſt her ordinary Moderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; then her Grief broke out publickly.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Cecil,</hi> ſays ſhe, <hi>What Miſchief hath your Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous Zeal, and Impatience done me!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>With that, ſhe burſt out into Tears, and would not endure the Careſſes or the Comforts of any about her.</p>
                  <p>While the <hi>Queen</hi> abhor'd her ſelf, for the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders her Anger had given; <hi>Cecil,</hi> who had ſo faithfully caus'd them to be executed, enjoy'd the Pleaſure of having procur'd them: And the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſs of <hi>Nottingham</hi> Triumph'd in her ſelf, for the Revenge ſhe had taken of a Man who had ſlighted her Charms.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="244" facs="tcp:60459:133"/>'Tis impoſſible to expreſs the Grief of the Counteſs of <hi>Eſſex:</hi> the moſt Stony Hearts had Tears for her. The <hi>Queen,</hi> (whoſe Anger was dead with the Earl) ſent to comfort her, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure her, ſhe was at Liberty, and might diſpoſe of her Husband's Eſtate.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Let Her take my Life, and keep Her Pity to Her ſelf,</hi> (ſays the <hi>Counteſs</hi> to the <hi>Queens</hi> Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger) <hi>She hath Robb'd me of all that made my Life dear to me; and 'tis not in Her Power, to repair the Miſchief ſhe hath done me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> his Friends, finding her, at preſent incapable of Comfort (even from them whom ſhe eſteem'd highly, for their Love to the <hi>Earl</hi>) took her from <hi>London,</hi> in hopes, that Time might make her Suſceptible of that Conſolation, which the Violence of her preſent Sorrows ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd altogether vain.</p>
                  <p>As for the <hi>Queen,</hi> She languiſh'd out the reſt of her Life: The only Comfort ſhe had, was to think the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> had ſlighted Her to his Death, and never made Her any Submiſſion.</p>
                  <p>The Counteſs of <hi>Nottingham</hi> had ſmall Joy of her Faithleſs Life. A violent Malady ſeiz'd her, and made her ſenſible of the Horrours of Death: Remorſe of Conſcience tormented her; the Ghoſt of the <hi>Earl of Eſſex</hi> (whoſe Death her Cruelty occaſion'd) ſeem'd to Haunt her inceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantly. And being at the point of Death, ſhe could not depart, without acknowledging her Crime to the <hi>Queen.</hi> Having begg'd one Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments Audience, ſhe confeſs'd all that had paſs'd between the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> and her, the Love ſhe had for him, the Implacable Hatred that ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded it, and her Perfidiouſneſs in keeping the
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:60459:133"/>
RING he had truſted her with. With that ſhe preſented the RING to the <hi>Queen;</hi> who was ready to dye at the receiving it; and was with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in very little of making the dying Counteſs feel the violence of her Reſentment.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Wretch,</hi> crys ſhe, with looks full of Indignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>What Remorſe haſt thou expos'd me to! Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Heaven will Pardon thy Crimes I know not; ſure I am, I ſhall never forget them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Having thus ſaid, the <hi>Queen</hi> went out, and the Counteſs in few Hours Dyed.</p>
                  <p>This prov'd a Mortal Blow to the <hi>Queen</hi>'s Health; who not long after Dyed, uncomforted for the Death of the Earl of <hi>Eſſex.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Cecil</hi> had lov'd the Counteſs of <hi>Nottingham</hi> too well, to be eaſily Comforted for hers.</p>
                  <p>By the Death of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> the Crown of <hi>England</hi> paſs'd into the Illuſtrious Houſe of the STUARTS, whoſe Right it was: King <hi>James,</hi> after a Glorious Reign, left it to his Poſterity, for the Repoſe of his Kingdom.</p>

                  <p>AS I doubt not, on one ſide, but this Title comprehends, in reality, a moſt numerous and powerful Party, and am proud and full of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence having put my ſelf under your Protection, —<hi>Cornua ſumo;</hi> ſo on the other ſide I loſe much of my aſſurance, when I conſider that it is to deſtroy the very being of your happy condition, to imagine that any of you will think your ſelves concern'd in this Dedication, ſince that very thought would make you really ceaſe to be ſo, and rank you in another herd amongſt the Jealous and Suſpici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, to whom I do not apply my ſelf. It is to you (Gentlemen) I ſpeak, who are ſure you are not ſpoken to; It is to you only our reſolute <hi>Don Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briel</hi> ſubmits himſelf, though at the ſame time like a blunt Souldier, as he is, he tells you, that even to you he yields in nothing but his Fortune, which it ſeems, was as obſtinately bent to force upon him the knowledge of that fatal ſecret, as he was to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void it; and though he confeſſes he was guilty of much weakneſs in permitting himſelf to be carried away by the importunity of <hi>Don Fernand,</hi> even ſo far as to watch the actions of his Wife (a horrid ſin in it ſelf) yet he deſires you to believe that even in that action he never conſented to any thought that ſuggeſted to him the leaſt doubt of her Virtue, but Arm'd his Soul with a ſtrong contempt of <hi>Don Fernand</hi>'s Jealous Humour; <hi>In fine,</hi> he had ſtill been as Happy as any of you, had not his unkind Deſtiny peeviſhly forced upon him that ſecret which
<pb facs="tcp:60459:136"/>
your kinder Fates ſo carefully keep from you, dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly kind indeed, ſince they both take from you the knowledge of a reality which would deſtroy your Happineſs, and with the Idea of an imaginary thing (your Wives Virtue) no where exiſtent but in your own Brains, make you really Happy? Here he ſubmits and acknowledges the advantages your favourable ſtars have given you over him; he adores that Heaven of Happineſs from which he is fallen, and inſtead of giving thanks to his officious Friend <hi>Don Fernand,</hi> or others, who had contributed to Awake him out of his Golden Dream of Security, he cries out with the Grecian in <hi>Horace,</hi>

                  <p>IN the Reign of <hi>Philip</hi> the Second, a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, named <hi>Don Fernand,</hi> govern'd in <hi>Catalonia</hi> in quality of <hi>Vice-Roy;</hi> a Man (to give him his true Character) of a moſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable humour, and endued with extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary quality; but much addicted to Pleaſures, and above all, to thoſe of Love, which he pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued even with the Hazard of his Reputation.</p>
                  <p>He marryed one of the greateſt Beauties of <hi>Spain,</hi> a virtuous young Lady, and of ſo Pleaſant a Wit and Humour, that any other but he would have found reaſon to have been highly ſatisfy'd in her; but there are ſome Husbands who think no Women ſo bad as their own, of which Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber <hi>Don Fernand</hi> was. The quiet Poſſeſſion pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him, and being diſguſted with the continual ſerving up of the ſame diet, he was reſolv'd to divert himſelf with change when he could, at the Expence of others.</p>
                  <p>He had for theſe ſome Months us'd to Hunt upon the Grounds belonging to the <hi>Grand Maſter</hi> of the Artillery; whoſe Wife, though not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether ſo abſolute a Beauty as his own, yet ſhone with ſo many charms, as that few of her ſex could ſtand in competition with her; and withall, was extreamly pleaſant and divertive in her hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, and of the moſt pleaſant and gallant Wit in the World. —In a Word, a Woman exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:60459:137"/>
fram'd to his own Mould, and Temper.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Grand Maſter</hi> was a Man perfectly cut out for War, and ſo conſequently, you may gueſs, very unfit for the <hi>Court.</hi> He bent all his mind to the Duty of his charge, and left the Affairs of his Houſe to the manage of his Wife, of whom he had a good opinion, being of a Temper, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Genius of thoſe of his Countrey, not at all inclined to the yellows.</p>
                  <p>Some Relation between him and the <hi>Viceroy,</hi> together with the Friendſhip that was contracted between the two Ladies who had been long ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted, ſerved for an inducement to bring the <hi>Grand Maſter</hi> to Court, where <hi>Don Fernand</hi> would needs honour him with a particular Apartment.</p>
                  <p>Hitherto all went well; neither did any one perceive the <hi>Viceroy</hi>'s deſign upon <hi>Donna Angelica</hi> (ſo was the <hi>Grand Maſters</hi> Lady called:) he ſpoke not to her but with his eyes, and by his handkerchief, which in that Country, ſerves for a Love-Interpreter as well as the eyes: But now ſince of an outward he had made a domeſtick Amour, the convenience of daily ſeeing and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaining the object of his Ardent Affections, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed his Paſſion to ſuch a Height, that it could be no longer kept a reſerve from the quick ſight of ſo penetrating a Lady as his was.</p>
                  <p>A little Jealouſy is ſufficient to diſunite two Women; A bare ſuſpicion will diſſolve the ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Tye of Friendſhip that can be between them. The <hi>Viceroy</hi>'s Lady began to look very indifferent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon <hi>Donna Angelica</hi> without aſſigning to her any reaſon for it: For moſt commonly one Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man does not love to betray the jealouſy ſhe poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly may have of another; that ſeems to her to
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:60459:137"/>
be ſuch a Point of Honour, as ſhe will never, but in the laſt extremity, and when ſhe is no long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er capable of concealing it, diſcover the reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſigns of this weak paſſion in her.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Donna Angelica</hi> ſoon perceived the change, and as ſoon gueſt the occaſion of it; yet ſhe beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved her ſelf in her uſual manner towards the <hi>Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roy</hi>'s Lady. A Woman takes an extream Pleaſure to ſee her ſelf beloved, eſpecially by a Perſon of Quality and deſerving Merit as <hi>Don Fernand</hi> was But <hi>Donna Angelica</hi> ſhewed ſo much diſcretion in her converſation with him, that his Lady had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to ground a Quarrel on. But that diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was wanting in him, whoſe Paſſion was rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to ſuch a heighth, that it was not in his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to reſtrain it.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Viceroy</hi>'s Lady, who would no longer ſerve them towards the convenience of their inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>views, ſeeing that <hi>Donna Angelica</hi> abated nothing of her free and indifferent carriage, he refus'd her the ordinary civility of entring into her Chamber, where he us'd frequently to wait on her; and which had ſerv'd the <hi>Viceroy</hi> as a pretence in his Viſits to her. <hi>Donna Angelica</hi> could not diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble this affront, the injuſtice of it being too great conſidering the freedom of her converſation where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with ſhe had hitherto treated <hi>Don Fernand;</hi> and ſhe was now reſolv'd to be reveng'd, and ſpare nothing whereby ſhe could be able to make her jealous in good earneſt.</p>
                  <p>It is ſomething dangerous to provoke an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, when it lyes in his power to do us more miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief then yet he has done: <hi>Donna Angelica</hi> had no ſooner ſeen the <hi>Viceroy,</hi> but aſſuming to her ſelf a more ſerious countenance than ordinary;
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:60459:138"/>
Sir (ſays ſhe) I know not what Pleaſure you can take in making diſſention betwixt your Lady and me: I, Madam? anſwered <hi>Don Fernand,</hi> abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely aſtoniſht at the Reproach ſhe made him: Yes, you, your ſelf, replys ſhe: you make her by ſome of your actions imagine that you love me, and ſhe by hers would confirm me in my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of the ſame. I did not think, anſwered the <hi>Viceroy,</hi> ſmiling, that I could ever have been ſo much oblig'd to my Wives ill humour, as that ſhe ſhould make a declaration of love for me; but ſince it is ſo, Madam, I wiſh ſhe may al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways continue it, for I ſwear to you, nothing is ſo true as what ſhe would perſwade you to; And Madam, I love you to ſuch a degree as no Man yet ever loved before me. I perceive (re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plys ſhe) that ſhe is already extreamly jealous, but ſhe ſhall be ſufficiently puniſht for it. Yes, Madam, replyed the <hi>Viceroy,</hi> if you would but love me a little; Not ſo, replied ſhe, although indeed any other would do it perhaps through re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, if not through inclination; but, added ſhe, laughing, I deſire not to puſh on my revenge ſo far.</p>
                  <p>This Diſcourſe was interrupted by ſome Ladies who came to viſit <hi>Donna Angelica,</hi> and the <hi>Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roy,</hi> being oblig'd for that time to retire, writ a Lettter to the Lady the ſame day to this purpoſe.</p>

                        <p>Revenge your ſelf, Madam, revenge your ſelf of the Vice-queen, who has had the Curioſity to pry into the ſecrets of my Heart; ſhe is perſwaded that none can have ſo tender and ardent a Paſſion as that I bear you; that I think of none but you, that I ſeek nothing but you, and that I have no Pleaſure but when I ſee you, and am ſo happy as

                  <p>This Letter was deliver'd to <hi>Donna Angelica,</hi> which ſhe read not without a Smile, but return'd him no Anſwer; nevertheleſs the <hi>Viceroy</hi> from this time, ſaw that his affairs were not attended with any extraordinary ill Circumſtances.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Vice-queen</hi> perceived ſhe had committed an errour, and that by refuſing <hi>Donna Angelica</hi> the priveledge of her Chamber, ſhe had given her Treacherous Husband a fair occaſion to ſee her in private. Her Jealouſy daily encreas'd, ſhe ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin'd a thouſand times more then was indeed, and ſhe ſuffer'd more trouble in one poor moment, by what ſhe ſaw not, then ſhe had in many days by what ſhe had ſeen: ſhe was forced to change her conduct, and to feign a deſire of renewing her friendſhip with a Woman whom ſhe hated more then Death. To how ſad a point is a poor La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy reduced, when ſhe is ſo innocent as to trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble her ſelf about the little Follies of her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:60459:139"/>
and dares not render him <hi>quid pro quo!</hi> She would fain have had this ſatisfaction (though a very afflictive one) of ſeeing what paſſed betwixt theſe two perfidious Creatures, and putting a check to their Pleaſure by her Preſence, for ſhe was from Morning until Night either with the one or the other.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Viceroy</hi> was extreamly weary of her ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Company, he could have wiſht with all his Heart, that ſhe had continued her ill humour and quarrel to <hi>Donna Angelica.</hi> Whatever he did, ſhe would make one: if he walk't out, ſhe did ſo too; if he went to pay a viſit to <hi>Donna Angeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca,</hi> ſhe followed him, and would be the laſt there; I leave it for your Marry'd, Young, Brisk Gallants to judge, whether this was not damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble troubleſom. He knew not what to do: <hi>Donna Angelica,</hi> who loved him not to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of her Reputation, would contribute no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, on her part to make him more happy, for fear of giving the <hi>Vice-queen</hi> an advantage over her, who poſſibly waited but for an opportunity to ruine her. So that being in deſpair with anger and vexation, after having ſought a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand ways to rid himſelf of this trouble, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out meeting ſucceſs in any, he at laſt bethought himſelf of an expedient queint enough, and ſuch as few <hi>Spaniards</hi> would have thought on. But the <hi>Aſcendant</hi> of Love often carries them above that of their Nation. He believ'd that Women were not jealous of their Husbands, but for want of ſomething elſe to amuſe them, and that, as one paſſion drives away another, he ſhould quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly put an end to the <hi>Vice-queen</hi>'s jealouſy, if he could find her out a Man capable of making a
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:60459:139"/>
tender impreſſion of Love upon her. He ſtudyed a good while whom he ſhould make choice of, to do him ſo important a ſervice, without pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice to his Honour: the affair was pretty nice and delicate; but when a Man loves to that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree that he loved, and is fir'd with the thoughts of enjoying thoſe pleaſures he was in ſearch of, he muſt paſs by a great many ſuch Scrupulo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities.</p>
                  <p>In fine, having run over in his mind all the Gallants of his Court, that were capable of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiring Love into the breaſt of a young Lady, he caſt his eyes at laſt upon a young <hi>Neapolitan</hi> Lord, ſomething ally'd to him, and for whom he had procur'd a Regiment of Foot; and who was newly arrived at <hi>Barcellona:</hi> he was young, full of ſprightly air, for whom the <hi>Vice-queen</hi> had already a particular eſteem, and he could not elect a Centleman more fit for his deſign.</p>
                  <p>He found him one evening walking alone in the Park, and having taken him with him, he fell into the diſcourſe of the Ladies of <hi>Barcellona,</hi> and ſmiling, askt him how he found himſelf, whether he had hitherto preſerv'd his Liberty, and if he were not engag'd in ſome Amour. My liberty is entire, anſwer'd the young <hi>Neapolitan.</hi> How! replys the <hi>Viceroy,</hi> among ſo many fair Ladies in this City, has no beauty had the power yet to reach your heart? either you have a very obdurate one, purſues he, or I muſt believe you have left a Miſtreſs in <hi>Naples</hi> to whom you will not be unfaithful. Neither the one nor the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Sir, replys the Colonel; I was never amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous; not that I am inſenſible of the paſſion, but the buſineſs and art of War pleaſes me better
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:60459:140"/>
than that of Love. You are young, ſays the <hi>Viceroy,</hi> ſmiling; and you ought not to have ſuch Ideas, for the one does not hinder the other; you may make Love, and yet very well diſcharge the duty of a Soldier. Nay, I will tell you more then that, continues he; there was never any great and perfect Warriour but who was made ſo by Love; and ſo ingaging him further in that diſcourſe, he began to number up I know not how many Great Captains, who owed the moſt glorious Actions they ever performed, to the inſpirations of Love; and he concluded at laſt that he muſt imitate their Example, if he would not paſs for a <hi>Barbarian.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Count Henry</hi> (for ſo the young <hi>Neopolitan</hi> was called) yielded himſelf to the <hi>Viceroy</hi>'s ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, but more out of complaiſance, than through any inclination, judging very well that it would not become a young Courtier as he was, to diſpute againſt a paſſion, on which all the World knew the <hi>Viceroy</hi> was ſo violently bent: I will court a Miſtreſs then, ſays he, ſince you adviſe me to it. <hi>Don Fernand</hi> demanded of him, whether he would not be content to receive her from his hands; at which propoſition the Count began to laugh, but made no anſwer. Do you fear then, purſued the <hi>Viceroy,</hi> that I ſhall not ſerve you to your ſatisfaction; I know how to acquit my ſelf in ſuch an affair, but too well, <hi>Seignior,</hi> ſays he, and for that very reaſon it will be dangerous to owe that obligation to you: No, no, you need fear nothing, ſays <hi>Don Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand,</hi> ſmiling; it is true, I have loved the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy whom I would willingly beſtow on you for a Miſtreſs; but ſhe is at preſent a trouble to me;
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:60459:140"/>
and I hate her almoſt as much as ever I loved her. What a fine preſent, Sir, ſays the Count, interrupting him, do you make me then? will not the kindneſs you have for me, inſpire you with ſomething more obliging than to charge me with a Woman you know not what to do with? No Sir, ſays <hi>Don Fernand,</hi> and I may tell you withal, the offer I make you deſerves not to be refus'd, and there are few men would have been ſo generous as I am in it: If you pleaſe Sir, (re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies the Count) honour ſome other Perſon with your liberality; for I muſt return to what I have already told you, that notwithſtanding the examples of ſo many Heroes that have loved, yet War pleaſes me better. Lord <hi>Henry,</hi> ſays the <hi>Viceroy,</hi> the Perſon I ſpeak of is one of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt beauties in this Kingdom, and in wit and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity not inferiour to any: I believe it, Sir, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies the Count, but ſhe is withal a Woman, Peeviſh, Conceited, Croſs, Spiteful, Jealous, Imperious, and poſſibly worſe than all this. You do not know, ſays <hi>Don Fernand,</hi> ſmiling upon him, and folding his Arms, that it is my Wife you ſpeak of: Yours? anſwers the Count bluſhing, and thinking he had miſunderſtood him: My <hi>Vice-queen,</hi> replies <hi>Don Fernand,</hi> whom I intend to beſtow on you for a Miſtreſs: conſider whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhe be ſo unworthy of you. It is true, Sir, ſays the Count, bluſhing more and more, I have made ſome viſits to your Lady the <hi>Vice queen,</hi> but it has been with your permiſſion, and I thought I had not been ſo unhappy, as to have cauſed any unjuſt ſuſpicions in you by my conduct, you mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake me, anſwers the <hi>Viceroy,</hi> I tell you, that if you like my Wife, it would pleaſe me ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:60459:141"/>
to ſee her made ſenſible of your deſerts; and you will oblige me by endeavouring to make her ſo; do I now ſpeak plain? If this rail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery, <hi>Seignior,</hi> anſwers the Count, is but to make a tryal of my reſpect, I declare unto you, I am ſo Religious an obſerver of my Duty, that, ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting aſide the high Obligations I have to you, ſo great a Sacriledge would never enter into my thoughts. The <hi>Viceroy,</hi> thereupon walkt a while without making any anſwer, and then turning ſuddenly towards the Count; All this, ſays he, would be proper for another in another Conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture; but ſince I deſire not this reſpect or duty from you, can you do me any diſpleaſure, think you, by ſerving me my own way? I tell you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, purſues he, raiſing his voice a little higher, you will oblige me extremely, if you will make love to my Wife, or at leaſt endeavour to make her ſenſible of your Love. Count <hi>Henry</hi> more aſtoniſht than ever, at the ſtrangeneſs of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, knew not what to think, nor what anſwer to make. At which the <hi>Viceroy</hi> laughing, I ſee, ſays he, this diſcourſe ſurpriſes you, and you have reaſon, but I have mine too. I love moſt paſſionately, even more than ever, and the greateſt Obſtacle that oppoſes my Love, is my Wife, and what would not a paſſionate Lover do to remove ſuch an obſtacle? She is jealous, and troubles me continually with her importunities. What remedy is there for me? I have try'd a thouſand ways in vain, ſhe hath counter turn'd all my inventions, I am continually wearied with her endleſs complaints and reproaches. She follows me where ever I go; and poiſons with her Preſence all the pleaſures of my Life. I have
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:60459:141"/>
fancied that ſomething which may amuſe her, would do me Knight-ſervice, and much relieve me, and that you are a Man very proper to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire love into her Soul. You are Young, Hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, Pleaſant in your Humour, have abundance of Wit, and ſhe has an eſteem for you. It is true, ſhe is proud and haughty, but ſtill ſhe is a Woman as other's are. For my part, knowing the Sex ſo well, I doubt ſo little of your ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, that I muſt deſire you to keep ſuch mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration in it as I may hope from a Relation and Friend. You are diſcreet, and I confide in you, you know well enough how far the ſervice I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of you ought to extend.</p>
                  <p>The Count, after ſome oppoſition of accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch an Employment, either out of complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance to the <hi>Viceroy,</hi> or elſe becauſe the <hi>Vice-queen</hi> pleaſed him, at length ſuffered himſelf to be overcome by the <hi>Viceroy</hi>'s perſwaſions, which reacht ſo far as to let, him underſtand that he would not complain, though to the prejudice of his Honour, this amuſement ſhould happen to be carried on ſomewhat further then he deſired.</p>
                  <p>Thus they parted, the <hi>Viceroy</hi> highly ſatisfy'd that he had engaged the Count, in a ſervice, which another would have fear'd to have entred into. And the Count, on the other ſide, wond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring at the charge of ſuch a commiſſion as this, which was laid upon him. He had never been ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much in love himſelf, and he could not well conceive, how any one ſhould be ſo far tranſpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with that paſſion. The <hi>Viceroy</hi> was to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Ladies the next night at a ſupper, which was to preſent the New Gallant with an occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of entertaining his Miſtreſs.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="262" facs="tcp:60459:142"/>The <hi>Vice-queen,</hi> (as I have already told you) was a very beautiful Perſon, and ſuch a one, as <hi>Count Henry</hi> might very well make his applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to, without doing himſelf any conſiderable violence: Yet nevertheleſs becauſe it was a thing put upon him ſo, he found not in him that incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation which no doubt he would have had, had it voluntarily came from his own motion. Though her beauty was exceſſively charming, yet the too prodigal bounty of ſuch a Husband, was a great allay to a young Heart, which is ſooner engaged by the difficulty than the too great facility of the enterpriſe.</p>
                  <p>He was at this feaſt, where he appear'd ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing abaſht, and his Spirit was ſeiz'd with ſuch a melancholy, which was not uſual in him, for he was generally mighty Brisk, and a Perſon of one of the beſt humours in the World. The part he was to play had ſomething embroyl'd him, and taken off from his accuſtomed jollity that Evening. Not that the declaration of love, which he was to make, ſeem'd ſo difficult to him: there is leſs trouble in ſaying we love when we do not, than when we do; but that love is ſo ingenious as to furniſh a Man with a thouſand inventions which are impoſſible to come into the fancies of thoſe that are not poſſeſt with that paſſion.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Viceroy</hi>'s Lady appear'd that Evening more beautiful then ever; ſhe gave him fair play, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſhe fell upon him railingly twice or thrice about his melancholy: But the Count, more frozen and contracted than Ice it ſelf, ſcarce made a word of anſwer to all the raillery that the fair Lady was pleas'd to beſtow upon him. The <hi>Viceroy</hi> lookt on him with an eye of pitty; And
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:60459:142"/>
being aſham'd of his want of confidence, came up to him, and reprocht him with the title of the pooreſt and moſt pittiful Gallant he ever ſaw in his Life, telling him, if there were no better, the Ladies would be very much put to it. Sir, anſwer'd the Count, I will be what you pleaſe to ordain me, but I proteſt I muſt obey you in it with a World of Diſtraction, for I fear you may loſe more by it then you will get. And what does it concern you, briskly anſwer'd the <hi>Viceroy,</hi> what I gain or loſe? do but what I deſire you, and trouble your ſelf no farther.</p>
                  <p>The Count who could no longer excuſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, advances towards the <hi>Vice queen,</hi> who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving alſo a deſire to ſpeak with him, met him almoſt half way, and told him in whiſper, ſhe had ſomething to ſay to him, and deſired him not to go away before ſhe had ſpoke with him. The Count over-joy'd that ſhe had given him ſo fair an occaſion of obeying the <hi>Viceroy,</hi> deferr'd his Court-ſhip to that time.</p>
                  <p>When it was grown pretty late, and moſt of the Company was retir'd, the <hi>Viceroy</hi> waited on <hi>Donna Angelica</hi> to her apartment. Which his Lady had no ſooner ſeen, but ſhe made a ſign to the Count to follow her, and ſhe led him into her Cloſet, where having made him ſit down by her. My Lord, ſays ſhe, what is the cauſe why you are ſo extream melancholy? may we not ask you, purſued ſhe, with a moſt charming Air, whether it be not the effect of ſome Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? This queſtion, and the freedom ſhe had us'd towards him all that Evening, having made him ſuſpect that all this was a trick that the <hi>Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roy</hi> and ſhe had before agreed to play him, and
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:60459:143"/>
that they had a Mind to divert themſelves at his expence, he was upon the Point of ſpoiling all, but to ſhew he underſtood raillery; Madam, anſwered he, ſmiling, I have not been for a month together in ſuch a Court as this is, where there are ſo many fair Ladies capable of inſpiring the moſt tender Affection, without feeling the Power of Love: You love then, ſays ſhe. Yes, Madam, I do, replies the Count, ſince it muſt be ſo. How! ſince it muſt be ſo, ſays the Ladies, are you forc'd to it againſt your inclination. No, Madam, replys he, but there are, you know, certain Stars that incline our Hearts which way they pleaſe: ſaying this, he laught, and lookt on the <hi>Vice-queen</hi> with ſuch Grimaces, and Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures, which extremely puzzled her, to compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend the meaning of what he ſaid to her, and, to make him explain himſelf, May we not know, ſays ſhe, who this beauty is, to whom theſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous Influences have inclined your affections? Madam, anſwers he, with a good aſſurance; if you pleaſe to take the pains to conſult your Glaſs, it will ſoon ſhew you that beauty. I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand you not, ſays ſhe, putting on a ſerious Countenance, and I believe being what I am, I do you a favour in not being willing to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand you. If I may pretend to any favour from you, Madam, replies the Count, it is, that you would underſtand me, and be aſſured, that you need not go out of this Cloſet to find the object that has charm'd me in this Country. You for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get your reſpect, Sir, ſays ſhe, and now I ſee how far, the little too much eſteem I had for you, has carry'd you. But if you return not within the limits of your Duty, and forbear here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:60459:143"/>
ſuch diſcourſes to me, I ſhall be angry in earneſt. You are young, purſues ſhe, ſeeing him ſtruck Mute, and theſe are faults which may be excus'd in ſuch as you. If you have a deſign to love, added ſhe, learn where to addreſs your ſelf better, and in a place where ſomething may be hoped. Alas, Madam, reply'd he, my ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs is ſo bad the firſt time, that I ſhould do well never to love more. No, no, ſays ſhe, ſmiling, you muſt not diſpair of good ſucceſs: You will find others more ſenſible of your love then I am; and if you will let me adviſe you, I will tell you where you may direct your Languiſhing Courtſhip, and I dare engage you will be ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with the Perſon I ſhall chooſe for you.</p>
                  <p>This Adventure was pleaſant enough: For you ſee on the one ſide the Husband, on the other the Wife, endeavoured to beſtow a Miſtreſs on him. But he to croſsbite 'em, pretends to act the part of the ſcrupulous Lover, and to make a conſcience of being conſtant to his firſt Affection, and therefore immediately tells her, he cannot promiſe that his Heart will be able ſo ſoon to reſolve upon a change, that the choice he had already made was good, that nothing could con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſole him after ſo bad a Succeſs. Nevertheleſs, after a great many Motives ſhe laid before him, and even Entreaties which ſhe us'd, he feign'd at length to be overcome; and told her, ſince it was her abſolute Pleaſure, he would endeavour to obey her, though he could not do it without forcing his Inclinations; and in concluſion, askt her, who it was ſhe had judged proper for the Empire of his Heart? She anſwered him pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently, that it was <hi>Donna Angelica,</hi> who had
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:60459:144"/>
ſpoken to her of him that Day in ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, as gave her to underſtand ſhe was not inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of his Merits, and that if the Reſentments ſhe had of him were not tender and amorous, yet they contain'd an Eſteem which amounted to little leſs.</p>
                  <p>The Count would have been overjoy'd if what the <hi>Vice-Queen</hi> had told him had been true; for of all the Court Ladies, he had ſeen none that pleas'd him ſo well as <hi>Donna Angelica.</hi> The Truth was, ſhe had ſpoken very advantagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly of him to the <hi>Viceroy's</hi> Lady, but it was not without Deſign. The <hi>Viceroy,</hi> who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal'd nothing from her, had acquainted her of the Snare he had laid for his Wives Heart in the Perſon of <hi>Count Henry:</hi> So that, <hi>Donna Angeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca,</hi> who no leſs than he, intereſſed her ſelf in the Succeſs of this Plot, was reſolved to help on towards the advancing of it, by prepoſſeſſing the Lady's Heart with the good Qualities of this young Gallant.</p>
                  <p>The young <hi>Neopolitan,</hi> raviſht with Joy, that the <hi>Viceroy's</hi> Lady had ſo happily met with his Wiſhes, in the Choice of <hi>Donna Angelica,</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled, for the time, his Satisfaction: He only tells her, that after her ſelf, all other Beauties were indifferent to him; that he car'd not whom he received, provided it were from her Hands; but as for <hi>Donna Angelica,</hi> he had neither Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs to her, nor the Privilege of going to her Apartment. The <hi>Vice-queen</hi> bids him be at no Trouble for that; ſhe would remove all Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, and that, if he pleas'd, he might ſee her, and ſpeak to her in her Chamber, where ſhe came every Day.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="267" facs="tcp:60459:144"/>It is eaſie to gueſs what the Deſign of the <hi>Vice-queen</hi> was, in making a Love Intrigue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Donna Angelica</hi> and the Count. The Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy was ſomething beneath her Quality. But where the Intereſt of the Heart is concern'd, we paſs by the nice Scruples of Honour. She had a mind to give her Husband a Rival, and ſuch a one as might be formidable to him, and one whoſe Qualities were too charming, not to be as much beloved as he: For, judging of her Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy by the Faith ſhe kept to the <hi>Grand Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi> ſhe did believe ſhe would not prove more faithful to her Lover, than ſhe had been to her Husband. And indeed, ſhe judged well. The Tyes of Love are as eaſily broke as thoſe of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage; and where there is a mutual paſſing of Oaths, thoſe of the Wife ought to be as binding as thoſe of the Miſtreſs: If the former are vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, the others may very well be ſo too. A perfidious Miſtreſs and unfaithful Wife, are alike.</p>
                  <p>The Count knew not that it was to <hi>Donna Angelica,</hi> the <hi>Viceroy</hi> made his Pretenſions. This Amour had not as yet made any great Noiſe about the Court: He was a great Gallant, and whatever he did in this kind paſſed for a piece of Gallantry which was ordinary to him. He had not as yet acquainted the Count with his Love, and the <hi>Vice-queen</hi> conceal'd it from him, for fear the Knowledge of it might divert him, and make him ſcrupulous how to be jointly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd in a Love Affair with the <hi>Viceroy.</hi> So that, finding <hi>Donna Angelica</hi> a Woman exactly to his Humour, he reſolved, by the Aſſiſtance of ſo powerful a Confident, to attempt ſo fair an
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:60459:145"/>
Enterpriſe. The bare <hi>Idea</hi> of it made him amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous; and he was already impatient to ſee his charming Miſtreſs. The <hi>Viceroy</hi>'s Lady told him he need but come the ſucceeding Morning, and he might find <hi>Donna Angelica</hi> with her in her Chamber. He retir'd, full of this Hope, but was hardly got from her Apartment, when he meets with <hi>Don Fernand,</hi> who reproacht him with his Negligence: Why, Sir, ſays the Count, interrupting him, do you find that I have not perform'd my Duty well? I am but now come from the <hi>Vice-queen,</hi> I have been two long Hours with her in her Cloſet, where I have ſighed, talkt of Love, and feigned an Exceſs of Paſſion. What would you deſire more? I know not what you have done ſince I ſaw you, anſwers the <hi>Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roy,</hi> but a while ſince, you made me conceive ſo ill an Opinion of you, that I began to lay down all Hopes of finding any good Relief from you. You were ſad, dejected, and ſaid not a Word, is that the way to inſinuate into the Hearts of the young Ladies? That melancholy Air that I affected, Sir, anſwered the Count, is none of the worſt means to take ſome Hearts, at leaſt it was the means that perſwaded your Lady the <hi>Vice-queen</hi> to lead me into her Cloſet to ask me what the matter was. And there, in private, I told her what I had to ſay, and I hope, added he ſmiling, you will find your deſired Repoſe. I wiſh I may, anſwered the <hi>Viceroy,</hi> not being overfond of entring into the Particulars of that Converſation, and, after having encouraged him to purſue the Deſign, they each went away to their reſpective Apartments.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="269" facs="tcp:60459:145"/>The Morrow following, this new Lover, who uſed always to go extream rich in Cloaths, took a particular care to pleaſe his Miſtreſs in his Habit. He found her, as he had been told, with the <hi>Viceroy</hi>'s Lady, and as ſoon as they ſaw him come into the Chamber, they both fell a laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the different Thoughts they had of this Viſit, each looking upon the other as the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Miſtreſs of this Gallant: It was pleaſant to obſerve the Care they both took to render themſelves pleaſing to him. Do you not ſee, Madam, ſays <hi>Donna Angelica</hi> ſoftly, how deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licately he is ſhaped, what a ſweet Air he has, how particularly graceful his Perſon is. I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it all, ſays the <hi>Viceroy</hi>'s Lady, being over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy'd to hear her ſpeak in this manner, and I confeſs, if I were one of thoſe Women that would entertain a Gallant, I would make choice of <hi>Count Henry;</hi> for <hi>Donna Angelica</hi> did judge by the gentile Behaviour of the Count, and the Diſpoſition of the Lady, that if no Amour was yet a foot between them, it would ſoon be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun: And the <hi>Vice-queen</hi> was perſwaded, that <hi>Donna Angelica,</hi> being perſwaded, as ſhe was, of the Merits of the Count, either did already, or would quickly be brought to love him. The Count acquitted himſelf as to his part well enough for a young Scholar. He ſigh'd ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to one, ſometimes to the other, to the Satisfaction of both. When the <hi>Viceroy</hi>'s Lady made him a Sign, he went to <hi>Donna Angelica,</hi> and then returned to her upon the ſilent Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of <hi>Donna Angelica.</hi> Never was Man bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter diverted, all was well received from him, he had the Privilege to do what he pleas'd, and
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:60459:146"/>
they permitted him, each for the others ſake, all the little Liberty he had a mind to take with them.</p>
                  <p>Some Days paſt in this manner, during which time the <hi>Viceroy's</hi> Lady and <hi>Donna Angelica,</hi> gave themſelves this Diverſion, and where the <hi>Viceroy</hi> himſelf had no mind to be ſeen for fear of ſpoiling their Mirth. The happy Count en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy'd, alone, theſe fair Ladies Company, and grew every Day more familiar with them: He was very handſome as to his Figure, and of ſo free and airy a Humour, that it ſparkled through all his Actions, and his Company was very plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant and delightful to them. But <hi>Don Fernand,</hi> who beſides the little Advantage he had hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to got by it, began to fear, that Miſchief might happen to his Miſtreſs, which he intended only for his Wife, grew weary of their Divertiſements, and gave <hi>Donna Angelica</hi> notice, that ſhe would do him an extream Kindneſs to forbear being ſeen there any more, ſince ſhe was unable fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to contribute to that Deſign. But ſhe, who by no means would permit the <hi>Viceroy</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern himſelf about the Meaſures of her Conduct, and knowing from what Motive his Advice pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded, did but laugh at him, and went immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from dinner to the <hi>Vice-queen</hi>'s Chamber, where ſhe was ſure the Count would not fail to be: What is it to me, ſays ſhe, what the <hi>Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roy</hi> deſires, I will not deny my ſelf the Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of ſeeing the Count. I never paſs'd my Time more pleaſantly than ſince I was acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with him. The <hi>Vice-queen</hi> was of the ſame Opinion: They ſought not ſo much now to pleaſe one another, becauſe poſſibly they both loved
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:60459:146"/>
him, and it may be already repented they had been ſo liberal, and not endeavour'd to retain him each for her ſelf. But, as both of them had a good Opinion of their own Power to charm him, they flattered themſelves with a Conceit that they could retrieve him at their pleaſure.</p>
                  <p>The Count being with the <hi>Viceroy's</hi> Lady, and the time of going to take the Air drawing on, they propos d to walk in the Garden, when there came in ſome Ladies, to wait upon the <hi>Vice-queen,</hi> and their Viſit growing ſomewhat tedious, <hi>Donna Angelica</hi> whiſpers the <hi>Viceroy</hi>'s Lady that ſhe would ſtay for her in the Garden, with the Count in the Arbor, near the Labyrinth, and ſo they took their leave of her, and went both to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</p>
                  <p>This Lady did moſt extreamly long to know which of them had the geateſt Empire o're the Counts Affections, though ſhe did not much doubt but it was her ſelf, his Eyes, and all his ways of Expreſſions, as well as his Mouth, had ſufficiently confirm'd her in this Belief, but to avoid the ordinary Miſtake of Women, who are willing to flatter themſelves in this Particular, ſhe was reſolv'd to have from him a clear Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Truth; and they were no ſooner in the Arbor, but, beginning to laugh after a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry charming manner; for a young Lover, ſays ſhe, <hi>Count Henry,</hi> you have made a great Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs in a little time: You are but newly ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived in this Court, and you have got already ſuch an Eſteem among all the Ladies, that I I ſhould not very much flatter you, in ſaying it is arrived even to the point of Love. You are obliging, Madam, anſwer'd the Count, but I
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:60459:147"/>
ſhould be too happy, were the Progreſs I have made, capable of reaching your Heart. My Heart, ſays ſhe, with a kind of ſecret Joy that appear'd in her Eyes, you have no Thoughts of it, you queſtionleſs take me for the <hi>Vice-queen.</hi> No, Madam, replies the Count; I know to whom I ſpeak, and if either of us miſtake, it is you, if you imagine my Wiſhes and Sighs are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed to the <hi>Vice-queen:</hi> It is you, Madam, that are their fair Object, and they only aſpire at your Heart. And, ſeeing ſhe anſwer'd nothing (for poſſibly ſhe was then at a ſtand what to ſay to him) he made uſe of her obliging Silence; and having put one Knee to the Ground: Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, ſays he, moſt paſſionately taking one of her fair Hands, and giving it a thouſand Kiſſes, I have a long while waited for an Opportunity, to ſwear to you by all that is moſt powerful, and tender in Love, that not only I never had any other Deſign than to love you, but alſo that I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver will love any beſides your ſelf ſo long as I live. As he was ſpeaking in this manner, the <hi>Viceroy,</hi> who was by Accident then walking in Alley that led to this Arbor, ſaw him in this Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture; but at the diſtance he was from them, he could not well diſcern whether it were his own Lady, or <hi>Donna Angelica,</hi> that he ſaw. His Reaſon would fain perſwade him it muſt be the former, but there were ſome Motions of Jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie that began to torment him, having made him apprehend it might be the other; he was reſolved to be ſure, and therefore haſtes towards them to know the Truth. <hi>Donna Angelica</hi> was the firſt that perceived him, who haſtily making the Count riſe up from the Ground: What have
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:60459:147"/>
you done, Sir, ſays ſhe, the <hi>Viceroy</hi> has ſeen you, and I know not what he will think of it. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, anſwer'd the Count, I know not whether you may have any cauſe to fear on his ſide, but I am in deſpair for your ſake, although not in the leaſt for my own. It is upon your account I ſpeak, replies ſhe, and you know not poſſibly the intereſt he will take in it.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Viceroy</hi> no ſooner knew <hi>Donna Angelica,</hi> but changing colour twice or thrice, according to the different motions wherewith he was agitated, his voice failing, as if he had been ſtabbed to the Heart. Certainly, Madam, ſays he, the Count has either receiv'd, or does demand of you ſome extraordinary favour, to be in that ſupplyant po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture I ſaw him in at your feet: One or the other, ſays ſhe, being netled at his words, may poſſibly be true; but you may better be informed of it from him than me, to which purpoſe I leave ye together. The <hi>Viceroy</hi> would have ſtopt her, but ſhe deſired him to let her go, with ſuch an air, as <hi>Don Fernand</hi> durſt no longer oppoſe her in it.</p>
                  <p>Never was Lover ſo diſſatisfy'd as the <hi>Viceroy.</hi> What he had already ſeen almoſt gave him his deaths-wound, and for his comfort afterwards, ſhe fled from his ſight. He walkt about there without ſaying a word, his mind being tortur'd with a thouſand thoughts, each more deſtracting than other; and at laſt making a ſtop before the young <hi>Neopolitan,</hi> who was alſo in as dumb a figure as himſelf, By what I perceive, ſays he to him, without looking on him, you are one of thoſe who with great difficulty begin to love, but when once they are ſet in, none comes amiſs to them. A few days ſince, you knew not what
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:60459:148"/>
love meant, now one Miſtreſs is too little for you. The Count, which though young and unexperienc'd in theſe affairs, yet had a piercing wit of his own, readily apprehended, by the trouble he ſaw in the <hi>Viceroy</hi>'s countenance, as well as by what he had heard him ſay to <hi>Donna Angelica,</hi> that it was ſhe he was ſo deeply in love withall, and that it was his jealouſy only which had made him ſpeak in that manner, ſo that to repair the ill effect of this laſt adventure, he told him, that he was ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly ignorant of the ground of this reproach which he made him, and that if he were in love, it was with the <hi>Vice-queen,</hi> and that too in pure obedience to him, and that he had not thrown himſelf at the feet of <hi>Donna Angelica,</hi> but to render her his Acknowledgments for the many good offices ſhe had done him as to his Lady.</p>
                  <p>This reaſon, though plauſible enough of it ſelf, did not work a perfect cure upon the mind of the jealous <hi>Don Fernand,</hi> but however he was ſomewhat appeaſed by it. You <hi>Italians,</hi> ſays he, as a ſmall matter obliges you, ſo you carry your acknowledgments to ſuch an exceſs, that one would imagine you had received very high fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, and that no leſs then a perfect ſurrender of all was made to you, when indeed, very little or nothing is done for you. It was I, continued he, that deſired <hi>Donna Angelica</hi> to ſerve you in your love to my Wife, and it is to me only you are to owe the Obligation. And to leave you nothing more to gueſs of this buſineſs, but to repoſe an abſolute confidence in you, it is <hi>Donna Angelica</hi> whom I love; and therefore, that you might not be any longer deceiv'd, and that in leaving the <hi>Vice-queen</hi> to your dividend, let me deſire you
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:60459:148"/>
that you would forget to caſt your eyes on the other, and to avoid even being ſeen in her compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, at leaſt in private. If I were in your place, I know which of the two would pleaſe me beſt: and I muſt confeſs, there is no Woman I could love better than my Wife, were ſhe anothers; but ſhe is mine, and that title is ſufficient to give all Husbands a diſguſt who are of my humour and conſtitution. Do not think this to be any caprice; moſt marry'd men are of this temper, and I know alſo good ſtore of Wives indeavour to imitate them, and ſo to repay them in the ſame Coyn.</p>
                  <p>As he was diſcourſing after this manner, the <hi>Vice-queen,</hi> who as ſoon as ſhe could, had got rid of her viſitants, came haſtily into the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, with a reſolution, caus'd partly by curioſity, partly by Jealouſy, to over-hear <hi>Donna Angelica,</hi> diſcourſe with the Count, and paſſing through the Labyrinth, that ſhe might not be ſeen, ſhe came to the place time enough to over-hear ſome part of the moral diſcourſe her honeſt Husband held with the Count; ſhe liſtned with a great deal of patience, even with that which exceeded other Women, and ſhe heard the Count make her Husband this anſwer. Sir, the <hi>Vice-queen</hi> is certainly one of the moſt beautiful perſons under heaven, and a man muſt be then, as you ſay, her husband, not to love her; but likewiſe, you ought not to fear, that a man who is not her husband, and to whom you have given the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of loving her, ſhould not make his advantage of that bleſſing, and ſhould ever dream of enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging himſelf elſewhere: as for my part, I will ſtand firm, as a Rock to this inclination, as long as you ſhall think good to permit me.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="276" facs="tcp:60459:149"/>This Reſolution of the Count's did a little com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort the <hi>Vice-queen,</hi> for her Husband's contempt, who heartily endeavour'd to perſwade the young Gallant, that he could not make a better choice than that of his Wife, nor find a more Agreable Husband than himſelf, provided he came not to one particular point, which he kept for a reſerve, leaving him all the reſt. They parted thus from the Arbour, and being come to the Palace together, the <hi>Viceroy</hi> took his leave to go to <hi>Donna Angelica,</hi> with whom he was to make his peace before he went to bed, if he meant to ſleep quietly that night.</p>
                  <p>As for the <hi>Vice-queen,</hi> ſhe was walking ſtill in the Garden, making divers reflexions upon what ſhe had heard. What a vexation was it for a perſon of ſo many killing charms as ſhe abound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with, to think of the rare Dialogue, wherein her husband, with his uſual eloquence, had ſet forth the eſteem and love he had for her? Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of what condition or quality ſoever, can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver pardon ſuch kind of ſlights, eſpecially thoſe that are handſom. She call d him by the moſt injurious names ſhe could invent. Is it poſſible, ſays ſhe, that I can be ſo little valu'd, and that a man, for whom I have given my ſelf a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand torments, and whom I have loved hitherto even to the contempt of a thouſand that deſerv'd it better, ſhould himſelf labour for his own diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour? Oh Heavens! purſues ſhe, this indifference of his, or rather this inſupportable injury he does me, cannot ſufficiently be puniſhed. I ought to content a husband that is of this humour: I have yet the ſame charms and winning looks as I had, wherewith I might allure a thouſand lovers to
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:60459:149"/>
me, without giving him the trouble of ſeeking them for me; he ſhall not have cauſe to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain on that ſcore. I will ſee how for his pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence will extend; and I am a fool my ſelf if I make not him the greateſt of all mankind. Let me begin with this young <hi>Neapolitan,</hi> I perceive I am not indifferent to him, and ſince he is a Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant I receive from my husbands hands, let me entertain him ſo kindly as that he may have no cauſe to be diſſatisfyed. He will loſe more by it then my ſelf.</p>
                  <p>With theſe thoughts ſhe bore her ſelf company to her Chamber, and entertain'd her ſelf with them the greateſt part of the night, during which, ſhe confirm'd her ſelf in the reſolution ſhe had taken, of ſeconding her diſloyal husband's good intentions.</p>
                  <p>When a virtuous woman has taken the pains to convince her ſelf, and is fully perſwaded thto' the motives of Revenge and Honour, that the ſin is excuſable, neither virtue nor honour is of ſtrength ſufficient to oppoſe her.</p>
                  <p>The Count was extreamly out of humour, that he had met with ſo unlucky an encounter, with the <hi>Viceroy</hi>'s Miſtreſs. He foreſaw the conſequences of it, and he was not a little troubled at the Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution he had taken. To think no longer to love <hi>Donna Angelica</hi> was nonſenſe, becauſe already he was ſo far engag'd; and to continue it, was ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely to ruine himſelf. What in the world to do he knew not, as the caſe then ſtood, if he had been able to believe his intereſt in this fair one ſo powerful, as to perſwade her to agree with him in deceiving the <hi>Viceroy,</hi> they might then keep their love ſecret; but he durſt not flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:60459:150"/>
himſelf ſo far as to that point: he had a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, notwithſtanding, to ſatisfy himſelf in this particular, if he could find ever an opportunity for it, without plunging the <hi>Viceroy</hi> into new ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicions.</p>
                  <p>Whilſt he was labouring under this inquietude, he ſaw him come into his Chamber. The Count altogether ſurpriz'd at this viſit, preſently judg'd that ſome great important buſineſs had brought him thither. The <hi>Viceroy,</hi> obſerving in his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance the trouble that lay upon him, to put him out of his pain, after he had familiarly ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted himſelf on the bed-ſide where the Count was laid. You ſee, ſays he ſmiling, what it is to be in love by my being up ſo early; when you are as faſt taken in the Amorous lime-twigs as my ſelf, you will then ſleep as little as I do: and paſſing from this little preamble to the occaſion of his viſit, he told him, That <hi>Donna Angelica</hi> was mightily incens'd againſt him, even almoſt to the laſt extremity, for what he had ſaid the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before, in the Garden: You know, purſues he, whether I teſtified any kind of regret or jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſy, when I found you alone with her, though poſſibly I might have had very good ground for both. But however, ſhe has paſt a thouſand ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere cenſures upon that action. You muſt go wait upon her this morning, and, if ſhe puts you upon that Chapter, endeavour what you can to diſabuſe her; but above all, be ſure to take no Notice that I have ſpoke to you, or that I have in the leaſt made you my confident of my paſſion for her. If ſhe ſpeaks to you of the <hi>Vice-queen,</hi> let her underſtand that all your inclinations are bent that way for her. It is the ordinary frailty
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:60459:150"/>
of Womenkind to flatter themſelves that they are extreamly admired by the men, and you ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſeen them both together, ſhe perhaps may think you have made a dividend of your heart betwixt them; but let her underſtand your incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, let her ſee your heart is incapable of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doring any more than one Divinity; and that, having made choice of the <hi>Vice-queen,</hi> you have given up your ſelf abſolutely to be ſubject to her Empire.</p>
                  <p>After theſe, and a great many other good Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrances, the <hi>Viceroy</hi> went his way, and the Count, having dreſt himſelf to the moſt advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage he could, directed his way to the Palace, and found <hi>Donna Angelica</hi> bright as the Day, ſetting before her Toilet; ſhe bluſht when ſhe ſaw him, poſſibly at the remembrance of the laſt words he had ſpoke to her, and having made him ſit down, they both remain'd ſilent, perplext, I am apt to believe with the multitude of their thoughts, rather then want of matter for a Diſcourſe. But <hi>Donna Angelica,</hi> unwilling any longer to inſult upon the young Lovers diſorder, took pity on him, thereby to retrieve his Courage; I thought, ſays ſhe, you came here to ask my pardon for the boldneſs you took yeſterday in the Evening, but by what I perceive, you have forgot it alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. It is true, Madam, anſwers he ſighing, I am criminal enough to beg your pardon, ſince I have been ſo unhappy as to diſpleaſe you, but I muſt confeſs to you, though I were to expiate my fault with the laying down of my life at your Feet, I know not whether I could ever repent of what I ſaid to you; and if it be a crime to love you, I am in danger of being, all my life, the
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:60459:151"/>
greateſt criminal in the World. You do not feat then, replies ſhe, to offend me. Alas Madam, ſays he ſighing, I dread your leaſt diſpleaſure, but love is a God more to be fear'd than you. It is high time to explain my ſelf, and I am ſo wretched as not to pleaſe you, let me then at leaſt underſtand my misfortune. Well Sir, ſays ſhe, will you be ſatisfy'd if I tell you, that ſuch a Man as you, never ſigh'd in vain; ſhe could not bring forth theſe words without bluſhing, but they ſo ſtrangely poſſeſt our young Lover with a joyous tranſport, that flinging himſelf at her knees, he embrac'd them a thouſand times: She made him riſe, and told him, ſmiling, he ſhould have a care the <hi>Viceroy</hi> did not find him again in that Poſture, whom he was to look upon as his moſt dangerous Enemy. I know it, Madam, ſays he, in a tone wherein there was leſs aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and that he is already too well eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in your Heart, ever for me to hope to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place him: it is not on that point, replies ſhe, you ought to fear him, but it is becauſe he will have a Watch over your Actions, and if we are not wonderfully circumſpect, his jealouſie will bring a great deal of trouble to us both. Then the Count acquainted her with the viſit he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from him that Morning, and the Diſcourſe they had held, and that it was by his Order he had made her this viſit, and <hi>in fine</hi> each of them paſſing from theſe confidences, they intruſted one another with their deepeſt reſerves. The Count acquainted her with what had paſs'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween him and the <hi>Viceroy</hi>'s Lady, and <hi>Donna Angelica</hi> to requite him, conceal'd nothing that had paſs'd between the <hi>Viceroy</hi> and her ſelf:
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:60459:151"/>
Thus having diverted themſelves, they took their meaſures how to deceive both the <hi>Viceroy</hi> and his Lady: After which, having made a very fair pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs in ſo early an Amour, they parted infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſatisfied with each other.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Vice-queen,</hi> who uſed every Morning to receive a viſit from her dear Gallant, waited for him with more impatience than ever, and began to be quite and clean out with him for tarrying ſo long from her, as if he could have divined the favourable diſpoſitions of her heart towards him that Day. She could ſtay no longer, but immediately after Dinner, ſhe went to viſit <hi>Don<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na Angelica,</hi> to hear what was become of him: ſhe was told, he had paſs'd part of the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in her Chamber, which news, together with ſome other melancholly thoughts, put her clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly out of all good humour for the reſt of that Day.</p>
                  <p>The Count came not to her till about the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening, and found her in her Chamber very much indiſpos'd, and full of thoughtfulneſs. No doubt ſhe was thinking at that time of him. And ſhe receiv'd him with ſuch an indifference as gave him plainly to underſtand, ſhe had a quarrel with him; and he was not long ere he knew what it was; for, after he had uſed ſome importunities to beſeach her to diſcloſe, ſhe reproach'd him with a thouſand things, many of which he was not guilty of, and which ended all in the viſit he had made that Day to <hi>Donna Angelica,</hi> upon which ſhe made a long and ſmart deſcant. The Count anſwer'd her, that if he ſhould be in love with that Lady, he pay'd but the Duty of an O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to her in it: You are a Traytor, replies
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:60459:152"/>
ſhe, you have obey'd me without repugnance, and it appears but too plain, that I councell'd you nothing, but what was agreeable before to your inclinations, and thar in refuſing your heart, I only hindred you from becoming perfidious to me. You have yet ſo much power, Madam, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd the Count, over this heart, that if you pleaſe but to recal the gift you have made of it, it will eaſily return an abſolute Captive to you.</p>
                  <p>To ſpeak to her in this manner was indeed to deſerve the name of a Traytour; but he had reaſon to apprehend ſome danger from her, as well as from the <hi>Viceroy.</hi> He plainly ſaw, ſhe had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd him in an Amour with <hi>Donna Angelica,</hi> whom ſhe mortally hated, but with an intention to ruine her. Moreover, as he knew not what was in the Breaſt of this fair one, although he had of late diſcover'd ſome encreaſe of her incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation towards him, he did not imagine that what ſhe ſaid to her would be of ſo great a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence. But the <hi>Vice-queen,</hi> who really ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin'd, that the Count's inclination was greater towards her rival, had not any difficulty to be perſwaded to what ſhe was willing to believe, and ſo engag'd him to make his moſt tender ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes to her. The young Count, who after he had ſo happily paſs'd the Morning, was now full of Gallantry, added Treachery to Treachery, and ſaid to her, all he could have ſaid to <hi>Donna An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelica,</hi> inſomuch that the abuſed <hi>Vice-queen,</hi> fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly ſwallow'd all his Courtſhip, and was moſt paſſionately charmed with it.</p>
                  <p>Theſe ſort of Treacheries, are much in uſe as well among Men as Women; which is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:60459:152"/>
that we take a ſtricter care, and rely no more upon the faith of words then upon that of looks. The Heart it ſelf often proves a great Lyar; what it longs for one Day it has an aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to the next.</p>
                  <p>The young Count was ſomething tainted with the corruption of the Age: and the <hi>Vice-queen,</hi> though otherwiſe a very ingenious Woman, ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered herſelf to be deceived, becauſe ſhe extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wiſht all things juſt to the ſtandard of the young Courtiers Rhetorick to her.</p>
                  <p>He ſaw <hi>Donna Angelica,</hi> but it was privately, and from her, he came full of Love to make his Courr to the <hi>Vice-queen;</hi> He uſed the ſame diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe towards the <hi>Viceroy,</hi> whom <hi>Donna Angelica</hi> treated more favourably, to amuſe him, and not to make him ſuſpect that ſhe had any ſecret Intrigue with Count <hi>Henry.</hi> But it is impoſſible for a jealous Man, and a jealous Woman, long to be abus'd, by thoſe whom Love takes pleaſure ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to blind: It is very difficult when we are poſſeſs'd with a great Paſſion, to be always on the Defenſive part againſt another Paſſion; and if we are the leaſt forgetful before thoſe who watch us narrowly, we are ſoon caught.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Vice-queen,</hi> and <hi>Donna Angelica</hi> very ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom ſaw one another; the Jealouſie which had already embroiled them on their Husband's Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, had now alſo diſunited them on the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of a Gallant. As for the <hi>Viceroy,</hi> he was well ſatisfy'd with the Proceedings of the Count as to his Wife, but not as to his Miſtreſs, and while he was at reſt from the Importunity of the former, he was much diſquieted for the love of the other. The ſubmiſſive Poſture in which they
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:60459:153"/>
had ſeen the <hi>Neapolitan</hi> Count in the Garden, came continually into his mind, and he had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd ſo great a Change in <hi>Donna Angelica</hi>'s Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage and Behaviour ſince that time, who did ſometimes abſent herſelf for half a day together, ſo that no body knew what was become of her, that it gave him ſufficient matter for his Thoughts to work on.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Vice-queen</hi> was much happier then; for ſhe imagin'd ſhe had an equal return of Love from the Count, to that ſhe gave him; ſhe ſaw him every day, and took all the Liberty with him, that any Woman would take who cares not if all the World knows ſhe entertains a Gallant: She had a right to it not to be queſtion'd; nay, further, none could indeed tell how to ſay any thing againſt it. Her Husband would have it ſo; he was a Gallant ſhe had received from his own Hand, who had train'd him up on purpoſe to make him pleaſing to her. It is true, he had preſcribed him ſome Limits; but however, the <hi>Vice-queen</hi> was mightily pleaſed, in that he left her the means of revenging her ſelf on him, and it was in the tranſgreſſion of thoſe Limits, that the pleaſure of her Revenge conſiſted.</p>
                  <p>When Inclination is joyn'd with Revenge, we very ſeldom miſs our Blow: And Women eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, who have always their Revenges ready at hand. The <hi>Vice-queen</hi> found her ſelf one Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing extreamly inclined not to pardon her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band: She had had that Night a thouſand plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant Dreams of the Count, and poſſibly waited only for his coming, to make thoſe Dreams out: My Traitor of a Husband, ſays ſhe to her ſelf, is
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:60459:153"/>
abſent, I am alone, and if the Count ſhould come at this inſtant, I know not what I ſhould be able to deny him; and I am very ſure few Women in the World would have had my Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. What? Abus'd on all ſides by a Man, who, inſtead of adoring me as he ſhould do; does court another before my Face, even to the laſt Point of Gallantry! Nay, more juſt Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens! He ſeeks me out a Gallant to comfort me for his Diſloyalty, or rather to amuſe me, he teaches him Ways to pleaſe me, nay, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains of him that he does not pleaſe me enough. Oh! Had the moſt virtuous Women living ſuch Husbands as mine, we ſhould ſee if their Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour were able to hold out againſt ſuch cruel In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries. From theſe Thoughts ſhe paſſed to others more agreeable: She repreſented the Count to her Mind in a thouſand charming Ways; and the <hi>Ideas</hi> whereof fill'd her with an Impatiency of ſeeing him, not to be expreſt. But all the Deſires, and languiſhing Motions of her Soul, brought him not: Noon-Day came; and now ſhe prepar'd her ſelf to make him a thouſand Reproaches, being no leſs inraged againſt him than againſt the <hi>Viceroy,</hi> though in a very different manner.</p>
                  <p>The unfortunate Count was at that time em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broyl'd in a very troubleſome Buſineſs, and ſo could not much think of her: She had ſent twenty times to his Lodging, and as often to <hi>Donna Angelica</hi>'s, but could hear no Tydings of him. What Misfortune had happened to him, what was become of him, you ſhall now hear.</p>
                  <p>The jealous <hi>Viceroy,</hi> who had been advertis'd by ſecret Spies he kept over <hi>Donna Angelica,</hi>
                     <pb n="286" facs="tcp:60459:154"/>
that the Count viſited her almoſt every Night, had often attempted to ſurprize them together; but whether it was the good Addreſs of the Gallant, or whether Love was ſo kind to favour them, I can't tell; but ſo it was, that they had always the Happineſs to come off ſafe: So that being almoſt in Deſpair, and being infinitely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous at what Price ſoever, to bring about his Deſign, he had planted one of his Spies when it juſt began to be dusky, behind the Tapiſtry at her Chamber Door, to ſee when the Count came in, or ſhe went out to find him.</p>
                  <p>It is very well if we are but once happy in ſuch an Amour: Too much good Fortune oft times makes us negligent; and we find our ſelves very near a Precipice, when we think our ſelves juſt at the Zany of our Happineſs: But we ought not to rely too much upon our paſt good For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, and in matters of Danger, we ought to be as vigilent as our Obſervers. Heavens defend all Lovers from ſuch a jealous Man as this <hi>Viceroy</hi> of <hi>Catalonia,</hi> who had abandon'd his Wife to anothers Addreſſes, that he might have the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to make his Applications to a Miſtreſs with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being troubled in his Buſineſs.</p>
                  <p>He had Intelligence brought him about mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night, that his Rival was come, and ſlipt into a Cloſet that was near <hi>Donna Angelica</hi>'s Chamber. This News tranſported him both with Joy and Anger: He diſguiſes himſelf in the Habit of one of his Men, comes immediately to the Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet, and knocks ſoftly at the Door. <hi>Count Henry</hi> uſed every Night to come to that happy Place, where, when the <hi>Grand Maſter</hi> was in Bed, he paſt an Hour or two, as Affairs would give him
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:60459:154"/>
leave, in moſt pleaſant Converſation with <hi>Don<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na Angelica:</hi> And now hearing one knock ſo gently at the Door, he doubted not but that it was his fair Miſtreſs. He open'd the Door ſoftly, and perceived one with a Hat on, who endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd to force an Entrance; but being young and ſtronger than the Aſſailant, he puſht him back, and clapt the Door ſo ſuddenly to, that the <hi>Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roy</hi> ran a very great Danger of leaving Part of his Noſe behind him. Juſt at this time the <hi>Grand Maſter</hi> came from the Town, and hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Noiſe, as he paſs'd towards his Lady's Chamber, he askt what it was. The <hi>Viceroy</hi> had taken care to put out two Lights which uſually ſtood there; and hearing the <hi>Grand Maſter</hi>'s Voice, being ſeized with a ſudden Fear (for he would not for the World be ſeen in that Diſguiſe) endeavour'd to make his Eſcape, which he did not however acquit himſelf ſo well of, but that the <hi>Grand Maſter,</hi> in the Purſuit, regal'd him with his Cane; with which he gave him two or three ſevere Drubs, crying out, Thieves, Thieves: But he eſcaped for all this happily enough, if this may be call'd a Happineſs. <hi>Don<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na Angelica</hi> heard this Alarm in her Chamber, but felt it more in her Heart. They told her there was a Thief that would have broke into her Cloſet, but ſhe doubted it was her dear Count: So that trembling all over with Fear, ſhe came out of her Chamber, to ſee whether he were taken. The <hi>Grand Maſter</hi> told her he was not, but that he had ſo maul'd him with his Cane, that he did not believe he would come thither any more this good while. This News gave the affrighted Lady ſome Comfort, not but
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:60459:155"/>
that ſhe was much concern'd that her dear Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant had been ſo ill treated. But after the Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger ſhe thought he had eſcaped, ſhe thank'd her Stars that he had come off ſo cheap. Theſe are the Fruits of Love, which many young Lovers have ſometimes gathered before the Flowers: She made ſome Complaints within her ſelf, which being paſt, ſhe could not but laugh at the Reflection ſhe made upon the Adventures of Lovers, and how different their Days are, one from the other. She knew not that it was the <hi>Viceroy,</hi> that had been paid ſo handſomely for his Curioſity, and undergone the Puniſhment due to his extravagantly jealous Humour.</p>
                  <p>That unfortunate lover came home very much mortifyed as may be imagined, curſing after a ſtrange rate the folly of Love, but yet more <hi>Don<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na Angelica;</hi> I beleieve it was a pleaſant Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loque he entertained himſelf all that night, and if he had been with her, he had vented his paſſion in dreadful reproaches. He would not go to bed before he had writ to her a letter which he charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed one of his ſervants to deliver her the next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as ſoon as ſhe was known to be awake; He flouriſhed it over after this manner.</p>
                  <floatingText type="letter" xml:lang="eng">
                     <body>
                        <p>You are the moſt ungrateful of all women, and leaſt worthy to be beloved by a man of honour. It is in my power to ruine you; but I have compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion on you.

                  </floatingText>
                  <p>When he had writ this letter, and read it ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral times over, he went to bed a little comforted, and reſolved not ſo much as ever to think on <hi>Donna Angelica</hi> more. But alas! how little does a lover know himſelf? And when we have deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered up our reaſon into the power of a paſſion, how little reaſonable are we! No ſoul ever felt any torment comparable to that of the <hi>Viceroy</hi> that night. In the morning, when he began to ſlumber, for he was not to expect any ſound ſleep, news was brought him, that the <hi>Grand Maſter</hi> was at the door, and deſired to ſpeak with him. He knew not what ſhould be the cauſe of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thither ſo early, unleſs it were to inſult over him for the drubs he had given him with his cane, which he yet felt: he ſent him word that he was not very well, but however he might come in if he had any buſineſs of moment with him. The <hi>Grand Maſter,</hi> who thought it his duty to acquaint him with what had happened in his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partment, the night before, was not willing to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer telling him that theeves had broken into the Palace; and that he had come home in the criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal minute, to hinder them from ſtealing the pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty curioſities his wife had in her cloſet. He would have told him what ſwinging drubbs he had given one of them with his cane; but the <hi>Viceroy,</hi> to whom that relation was uneaſy, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted him, and told him he had heard all that paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, and further, that it was thought theſe theeves
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:60459:156"/>
were ſome ſervants that had a private correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence at his houſe: that he ought to watch them as well by day as by night, and that if he would give himſelf the trouble of ſearching that cloſet, he might poſſibly meet with one of them there ſtill. Sir, ſays the <hi>Grand Maſter,</hi> my wife has the key, and there is no way for them to get in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, except ſhe conſents and opens the door. There may be ſomething in that too for ought you know, replys the <hi>Viceroy,</hi> or they may have falſe keys; and I tell you, you ought not to be too confident, for there are familiar Robbers, who many times ſeek ſomething that is above your mony, or your choiſeſt rarities either: what can they ſeek above thoſe, ſays the <hi>Grand Maſter,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupting him, it muſt be either my honour, or my Life. As for the former, the virtue of my Wife ſecures that: and as for the other, I have no ground to fear; for I think there's none can ſay I am his enemy: However, replies the <hi>Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roy</hi> to him, go and ſearch that cloſet, and if you find any one of the theeves there, you may judge by his meen of what character the reſt are. The <hi>Grand Maſter</hi> took his leave without making any anſwer, and went directly home, wondring at the Reaſons which moved the <hi>Viceroy</hi> to ſpeak ſuch things as he did. He came into his wives chamber, who had but juſt received and made an end of <hi>Don Fernand</hi>'s obliging letter: but it madded her to the ſoul. He gave her an account of the diſcourſe he had had with the <hi>Viceroy,</hi> and of his imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation that the theeves that had been there the laſt night, were perſons more dangerous than they were aware of, and that he thought ſome or other lay ſtill perdue in the cloſet. Having
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:60459:156"/>
both of them laught at the <hi>Viceroy</hi>'s fancy, he would needs go himſelf, and viſit the cloſet: But <hi>Donna Angelica,</hi> who, after the letter ſhe had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from the <hi>Viceroy,</hi> had reaſon to apprehend ſome treachery, endeavour'd to divert her husband from that curioſity. Do you not ſee plainly, ſays ſhe, that he plays the fool with us. Prithee, how ſhould a thief, purſues ſhe, come into that cloſet; or if he had a falſe key as he ſpeaks of, could not he eaſily have made his eſcape before this. 'Tis true, ſays the <hi>Grand Maſter,</hi> but the <hi>Viceroy</hi> would fain perſwade me, that theſe thieves have greater de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns then we think for, and he hath left me in a kind of diſpute whether they aim at my honour, or my life. And how ſhould he know their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, ſays <hi>Donna Angelica,</hi> certainly he muſt have ſome intelligence with them if it be ſo. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, anſwers he, I am a little ſurprized at it, but for his ſatisfaction, and that he may not ſay I have ſlighted his advice, let us go and ſearch the cloſet. <hi>Donna Angelica</hi> follow'd him, and though ſhe thought her ſelf ſecure as to matter of the Count, yet her heart did ſtrangely bear within her at the apprehenſion of ſomething, though ſhe knew not what. But in ſhort they did ſearch the cloſet, though they found no bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy: The <hi>Grand Maſter</hi> was not ſatisfy'd with that, but he was reſolved to ſearch likewiſe all the chambers, and go the round, that ſo he might be able to give the better account to the <hi>Viceroy,</hi> and there was not a corner, wardrobe, no, nor even a cheſt of any conſiderable bigneſs, but he pryed into it. After all this labour to no purpoſe, he went to give an exact account to <hi>Don Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand,</hi> and was very importunate with him to know
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:60459:157"/>
the reaſon of thoſe ſuſpicions he had taken up concerning the theeves; but the <hi>Viceroy</hi> had no diſpoſition to extend his reſentments ſo far, and pretend to make a diſcovery of things which he was not able to go through with ſo effectually as he could have wiſh'd; which cauſed the <hi>Grand Maſter</hi> to think no more of the buſineſs, and only to fancy that he might perhaps be ſubject to viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Donna Angelica,</hi> was in no ſmall perplexitie: ſhe underſtood by <hi>Don Fernand</hi>'s letter that he was acquainted with what had paſt the night be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and that he knew ſhe was wont to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Count in that cloſet: This did extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly plunge her, and ſhe could not apprehend how the <hi>Viceroy</hi> ſhould come to the knowledge of all this; for ſhe did not in the leaſt imagine that it was he on whom the unlucky Cataſtrophe of that ſcene had fallen. In ſhort, ſhe knew not what to believe of it, and ſhe reſolved to write to the Count, to ſee whether he could not any better clear up this miſtery to her. She ſent a meſſenger to him, in whom ſhe repos'd a great deal of truſt, who after having ſought him two or three hours in vain, return'd to her with the letter, telling her he could neither find him, nor hear any news of him. But all this daunted not <hi>Donna Angelica,</hi> who imagin'd he might poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly have received ſome ſmall hurt from her husband, which might oblige him to conceal him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, from the ſight of his acquaintance, who might have made ſome conjectures upon it, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps to diſadvantage; ſhe was nevertheleſs ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much diſquieted, and thought it ſtrange, that he ſhould not have the civility, or kindneſs to
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:60459:157"/>
write to her after ſuch an adventure as that, which he could not but imagine would create her a great deal of uneaſineſs. She ſtood at the cloſet-window, which lookt towards the ſea, and reflecting upon all that had happened to her, ſhe ſigh'd and complain'd of the negligence of her lover; when, caſting her eyes by accident on the platform that was under the window, ſhe ſaw in a little lodge built for a ſentinel, a man that made her a ſign with his hand not daring to ſhew himſelf, for fear of being ſeen, from ſome other windows of the Palace which look'd that way. She lookt earneſtly upon him, not knowing at firſt who it might be; but at length, not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a great ſurpriſe, ſhe diſcovered him to be her dear Count, which gave her no ſmall trouble. There were upon this platform two <hi>Culverins;</hi> but the place being almoſt inacceſſible, they were little lookt after, and that gate which went to them was never open'd but when they had an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to diſcharge them: ſo that were was no danger of his being ſought for there; but the main difficulty was how to get him from thence. The window was ſo high, that ſhe could not imagine how he could get down without hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf. But they could do nothing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore night came on; that was the only time to remedy all. She writ to him in the mean while ſeveral little notes to comfort him, which ſhe threw down, together with ſome ſweet meats, and indeed whilſt he was under that ſevere fata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, without having any thing to eat, I am apt to think he really wanted ſome ſuch refreſhment as that, or elſe the comfort of her letters was not of it ſelf ſufficient to keep up his drooping ſpirits.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="294" facs="tcp:60459:158"/>Night came at laſt, having been long wiſht for by both the Lovers; and <hi>Donna Angelica</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving thrown him down a ſtrong Rope which ſhe had prepar'd for that purpoſe, the young Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant mounted up to the Window with an incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable Addreſs, and you may gueſs, that what he had eaten that Day, had not very much over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged him. What a Joy was it to the fair <hi>Angelica</hi> to ſee him in her Cloſet? It was ſuch as could not be moderated but by the Fear of ſome new Misfortune which might happen to them.</p>
                  <p>The Count acquainted her with all the Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents of the precedent Night, and with what had obliged him to leap down upon the Platform: She, on her part, told him the Conſequence of that Adventure, what Alarms it gave her on his account, and the <hi>Grand Maſter</hi>'s Diſcourſe thereupon with the <hi>Viceroy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>They concluded that it muſt be ſome of the <hi>Viceroy</hi>'s Spies, or poſſibly he himſelf that had been ſo ſhrewdly beaten. Then laught at the Thoughts of it, and they would have carryed the Diſcourſe out further, but reflecting upon the preſent Juncture of Affairs, they concluded they had railed at it ſufficiently, and it was time the Count ſhould withdraw, not doubting but that they ſhould be now more narrowly watched than ever; ſo that the Pleaſure of ſeeing one another, and of being together, giving way to the Danger that threatned them both, they began to ſtudy which way the Count might get out of her Apartment, and not be diſcover'd. There were in this Cloſet ſome Womens Cloaths, and the Count being of no extraordinary Stature, <hi>Donna
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:60459:158"/>
Angelica</hi> even ventur'd to dreſs him up in one of thoſe, and found they fitted him extraordinary well: She had no ſooner got them on, but the <hi>Grand Maſter</hi> knocks at the Door; <hi>Donna Ange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lica,</hi> though trembling with Fear, was forc'd to open it; and her Husband ſeeing the young La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, askt her whether that were one of the Thieves the <hi>Viceroy</hi> would have him fear, and ſo went out again, not ſtaying for an Anſwer, which happened very well to his Lady, for I believe at that time ſhe was in no extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good Condition to make him one, ſufficient to paſs muſter.</p>
                  <p>After ſuch a Deliverance, we cannot think our two Lovers would defer any longer taking their leaves of one another: The Count, having ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted his fair Miſtreſs two or three times, got out very happily, and came ſafe home to his Lodging. The next Morning, he was no ſooner out of his Bed, but he received this Letter from the <hi>Vice-queen.</hi>

                     <pb n="296" facs="tcp:60459:159"/>The Count went to ſee her; and, after ſome few Love Quarrels for his ſo long Abſence, for which he excusd himſelf as well as he could, they entred into a more particular Converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in which the <hi>Vice-queen</hi> us'd all her Charms to ſet him on fire. <hi>Count Henry,</hi> whoſe Spirit was under no Conſtraint as to this fair one, ſpoke the moſt endearing and moſt gallant things to her in the World, and ſuch as poſſibly he could not have ſaid, had he been extraordinarily in love; for Love, though it ſuggeſts ſome times very good Thoughts to us, yet it does not inſpire us with Boldneſs of ſpeaking them. The abuſed <hi>Vice-queen</hi> in the mean time anſwer'd his obliging Diſcourſes in ſuch a manner, as diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd how well ſhe was ſatisfy'd; one thing on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in this Gallant, diſpleas'd her; that having ſo much Love for her as he pretended; he had no more Confidence, but ſuffered all his Paſſion to conſiſt only in Words.</p>

                  <p>She look'd upon the Count with Eyes which drew him to her, and as ſoon as he approach'd, ſhe puſh'd him back, now making one Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint, and then another; and in fine, like a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man that ſought an occaſion to quarrel, and at the ſame time was deſirous to make Peace; tho' I leave it to the Reader to judge what War and what Peace it was ſhe deſir'd. She was in an Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs capable to inſpire any Soul with the moſt paſſionate Tenderneſs; for, beſides that the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi>
                     <pb n="297" facs="tcp:60459:159"/>
have naturally ſomething in them ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly charming, both Art and Love had mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally agreed, to make her ſo, and they had dreſt her in ſuch a negligent manner, that was able to poiſon the moſt obdurate Hearts. I know not what happen'd between them; and I ſhould be loath to ſpeak it, though I ſhould know; but this I know, that, beſides the Revenge to which the <hi>Vice-queen</hi> was carried out, ſhe was not a Woman that would be at all the Charge of ſuch a Scene to no purpoſe. A Man of Honour ſtands much upon his Fidelity to his Friend, but no Principles of Honour could reſiſt ſuch power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Charms. Some Days paſt in this manner, during which, the Count, who for ſome Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of Politie, did not viſit <hi>Donna Angelica,</hi> but made his Court to the <hi>Vice-queen,</hi> to amuſe the <hi>Viceroy.</hi> But Women are leſs diſcreet in Love than Men, eſpecially when they love as this La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy did. <hi>Donna Angelica</hi> had a dying Impatience to ſee the Count, and was angry at him, that he did not rather expoſe himſelf to ſome Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, than ſuffer her to languiſh as ſhe did; and though ſhe had her ſelf forbid him for ſome time to come to her, yet ſhe would have had him teſtified to her, that his Love was more power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful than her Prohibition; and that he lov'd her to ſuch an Exceſs, as made him uncapable of obeying her. Beſides theſe Complaints, which ſhe thought ſhe had reaſon to make of him, ſhe had her Jealouſie alſo, which not a little tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented her: She underſtood that he went every Day to the <hi>Vice-queen,</hi> and though ſhe had ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis'd him to do ſo, the better to conceal their Love, yet ſhe was ſo vext at it, that ſhe could
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:60459:160"/>

                  <p>What a Cruelty was this to the poor Count, into what a Gulph of Diſpair did the Peruſal of this Letter plunge him! He thought to go and wait on her that very Moment, either to juſtifie himſelf, or die at her Feet: But leſt his Raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs might ruine them both, he thought he could not uſe too much Circumſpection. At length he bethought himſelf, that as he had by the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe of Womans Cloaths, got undiſcover'd out of her Apartment, ſo the ſame Diſguiſe might be favourable to him, and get him into it. He was young, handſome, and well ſhaped, his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion was ſuch as might become a young La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy: And there was no Danger, that the <hi>Grand Maſter,</hi> with whom he had no Acquaintance, and who had ſeen him but once or twice <hi>en paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant,</hi> ſhould know him. He goes then to a young Lady, one of his intimate Friends, and deſires her to furniſh him with a Suit of Womens Apparel that might fit him. She brought him one, help'd him on with it, and it became him ſo extreamly well, that nothing could appear more charming. This done, he takes the ſame Lady's Coach, and being attended by one of her Women, that knew nothing of the Intrigue,
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:60459:160"/>
came to the Palace. He goes into <hi>Donna Ange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lica</hi>'s Apartment, deſires to ſee her, and is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted into her Chamber, under the Name of <hi>Donna Brigitta,</hi> a Country Lady, who came to wait on her from another Lady of her Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance. He was no ſooner in the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, but to his great Confuſion, he ſaw the <hi>Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roy</hi> there: But by good Fortune, <hi>Donna Angeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca,</hi> who came before him to receive the Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, hindred the <hi>Viceroy</hi> from obſerving his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order. The Jeſt was, that ſhe did not know him, and that ſhe would have him brought him further into the Chamber, but the Count ſoon put her out of her Ignorance, by ſqueezing her Hand, and ſhe was ſo extreamly ſurpris'd to ſee him, that ſhe ſtood a good while in a Maze, but at laſt ſhe recovered her ſelf, and led him into another Chamber, and preſently return'd to <hi>Don Fernand.</hi> But with what Trouble and Diſquiet I leave to the Judgment of any Woman, that has loved and found her ſelf in the like Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances: She had with her the moſt dangerous of all her Enemies, at leaſt, ſhe lookt upon him as ſuch; though he had an extraordinary Paſſion for her: And on the other ſide, was the dear Object of her Deſires, whom, for ſome Days, ſhe had not ſeen, and for the Sight of whom ſhe moſt paſſionately languiſhed.</p>
                  <p>To compleat all, in comes the <hi>Grand Maſter,</hi> who finding this Lady alone, and underſtanding ſhe ſtay'd for his Wife, who was with the <hi>Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roy,</hi> being a very civil Perſon, though naturally no great Courtier, he thought himſelf obliged to keep her company. The Count, as I told you, had a very winning Air with him. The <hi>Grand
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:60459:161"/>
Maſter</hi> eaſily miſtook him for a Country Lady; for he had not ſeen any ſo handſome in <hi>Barcelona;</hi> and though he was by his rough diſpoſition not much inclin'd to admire the Sex, yet he found this Lady ſo exceedingly adjuſted to his humour, that he even ſurpaſſed himſelf; he paſſed a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Complements on her after this manner: He offer'd, ſhe telling him that ſhe was but newly come to Town, to ſhow her the Artillery, to lead her to the <hi>Arcenall,</hi> and to walk with her upon the Ramparts, to ſalute her with the great Guns; and a thouſand other things belonging to his trade of War, and which he thought a handſom Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ought to love as well as he. This was the ſum of his Courtſhip and Gallantry to her: The Count, who was very complaiſant, ſeriouſly thanks him, as if thoſe were the greateſt Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations he was capable of laying upon him; and being deſirous to gain his favour, he lookt upon him in ſo obliging a manner, as was enough to gain the abſolute conqueſt of his heart. And no doubt the <hi>Grand Maſter</hi> would at laſt have made Love, had he known how; but as that was not his Trade, he contented himſelf with making her ſeveral other, as he thought, ſignal offers of his Service, either for herſelf or her Friends: And I believe he would have alſo made her a tender of his Purſe, had not <hi>Donna Angelica</hi> come in, to whom, according to the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> faſhion, he was to yield his Place, though it was extreamly againſt the grain with him ſo to do.</p>
                  <p>This amorous Lady had a great deal of trouble, to get rid of the <hi>Viceroy,</hi> but it was well repair'd by the charming ſight of her dear Count; ſhe lookt on him with admiration, and bluſht, not
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:60459:161"/>
with anger, for it was not poſſible for her to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve any againſt ſo dear, and ſo obliging a Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant; But rather with Love and Jealouſie, to ſee him ſo handſome and ſo attractive in that figure. Perfidious Man, ſays ſhe to him, with a charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Air, you ſee every day new ways to ſurpriſe me; but I had ſufficiently been reveng'd on you, had the <hi>Viceroy</hi> or the <hi>Grand Maſter</hi> diſcovered you; for they, you know, are two enemies, you ought to fear. No, it is your ſelf, Madam, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies the Count, whom I fear more than all the enemies in the world beſides; therefore let me beg of you to give me ſome aſſurance that you are not angry with me, and I ſhall be contented. And who, ſays ſhe, ſighing, can be long angry with you? The very ſight of you pleads your excuſe, Go, ſays ſhe, bluſhing, you know too well the way to get your pardon.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall not go about to acquaint you with the ſequel of this Diſcourſe; but we may imagine they would have ſeal'd the Articles of a firm Peace, had not Love, which ſtill delighted to be interfering, ſent them the <hi>Grand Maſter,</hi> who already being fired with a paſſion for <hi>Donna Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitta,</hi> could tarry no longer without ſeeing her. He took the pretence of telling them, it was Dinner-time, and deſir'd his Wife to perſwade the young ſtranger to dine with them. Theſe two young Lovers, who had not had time to make the full advantage of their interview, yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed without difficulty to the <hi>Grand Maſter</hi>'s re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt. Only the Count made ſome ſcruple for faſhions ſake, but it was to be the more earneſtly entreated, which the Lady did with ſo good a grace, that ſhe could not be denied. All Dinner-time
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:60459:162"/>
the <hi>Grand Maſter</hi> had his eyes fixt upon the fair <hi>Donna Brigitta,</hi> he carved for her, and forgot not to drink her Health. The Count and <hi>Donna Angelica,</hi> who obſerved all his earneſtneſs and care, could not forbear laughing at him. The new Lover never had been ſeen in ſo good a hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour in his life, and he took a great delight to ſee them meet with ſo pleaſant a Diverſion. The Count did as much as the decency of the Sex he had taken upon him would permit, to make him really Amorous, who never till then had been in Love with any thing but his Sword. The Count drank the <hi>Grand Maſter</hi>'s Health, he ſhewed him all the reſpect imaginable, he took all occaſions to oblige him, ſo that the <hi>Grand Maſter</hi> believ'd he had already got ſome place in <hi>Donna Brigitta</hi>'s affection. He ſpoke very highly of her Beauty, and ſaid, he was forced to confeſs, having made his Excuſes to his Wife, that he had never ſeen a more beautiful Creature in his life. <hi>Donna Angelica</hi> managed this Scene extreamly well, and play'd the part of a good-natur'd Wife, tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling him, ſhe would ſerve him as his Confident, but gave him warning that he was to expect a Rival. A Rival, replies he in a fury, being heat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed both with Love and Wine, and who is it that will diſpute here with me? The <hi>Viceroy,</hi> anſwers ſhe, if he ſees her; but that ſhall not be here, purſued ſhe; for, as a faithful Confident, I will keep her entirely for you. The <hi>Grand Maſter</hi> was ſo well pleas'd with his Wife for this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaiſance, that he could have given her the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire of the World, if it had been in his power, to expreſs to her the ſenſe he had of ſuch an extraordinary kindneſs.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="303" facs="tcp:60459:162"/>Dinner being ended, he kept his Wife and <hi>Donna Brigitta</hi> company a little time; but ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſome important buſineſs that indiſpenſably called him away, he was oblig'd, though with a great deal of regret, to take his leave of them. Whereupon the Count pretended he muſt be gone too: but the <hi>Grand Maſter</hi> oppos'd it, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed, beſides his own importunities, thoſe of his Wiſe, to oblige him to tarry till his return, which ſhould be within as ſhort a time as poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, telling them otherwiſe he would not go, how preſſing ſoever his buſineſs was. <hi>Donna Angelica</hi> frighted with this laſt Menace, as well as with that of the falſe <hi>Brigitta,</hi> told him, ſhe would take the charge of that Affair upon her, and that ſhe would lead the Stranger into her Cloſet, from whence ſhe would not ſuffer her to ſtir, till he return'd. The <hi>Grand Maſter</hi> earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly entreated his Wife to be as good as her word; and having waited on them to the Cloſet, for the better ſecurity, as well as to ſhew a piece of Gallantry, he lockt them in, and took the Key with him.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Vice-roy,</hi> who notwithſtanding the juſt ground he might have to complain of this Lady's imprudent Conduct, was now a little reconciled to <hi>Donna Angelica,</hi> being yet uneaſie and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieted; ſpent whole days in her Apartment; ſo that not being ſatisfied with his Mornings Viſit, which had laſted three or four hours, he came again after Dinner. Having met with no body, and being there well acquainted, he came as far as her Chamber, and hearing ſome laughing in the Cloſet, he put his Ear cloſe to the Key hole, and knew it to be the Count's voice, which made
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:60459:163"/>
him hearken more attentively, for he was unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling a word of their Diſcourſe ſhould eſcape him. I leave you to judge, whether it could be pleaſing to him or no. He reſolved at firſt not to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt them, but hear them patiently out to the end; but it was hard ſo long to reſtrain the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuous motions of his troubled Soul. The more he heard, the more his grief inlarged upon him. But what ſhould he do in this Circumſtance? he was almoſt at his wits end, and knew not what was his beſt courſe to take; to knock at the door was a trouble to no purpoſe; he might very well imagine they would not open it, without making him ſpeak, and much leſs if he ſhould ſpeak; and what meaſure ſoever he ſhould uſe, it would but the more adviſe them to manage their precaution. If he had follow'd the motion of his firſt thoughts, he had preſently endeavour'd to break open the door; but beſides that, the door was ſtrong e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for the efforts he was able to make againſt it, he had ſo much reaſon remaining in him, as to ſee it did by no means become a Perſon of his Character, to uſe that violence in anothers Apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and if he made any noiſe, he apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that the worſt conſequences of it might light upon himſelf. He concluded then, it was his beſt way to wait there without making any buſtle, till they came out, or the <hi>Grand Maſter</hi> would come in. For he was reſolv'd this time to undo them, and the occaſion was too fair to be ſlipt. Thoſe in the Cloſet continued ſtill their Merri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. But the deep ſighs the <hi>Viceroy</hi> fetch'd (who ſitting on a Chair he had plac'd near the door, the better to overhear them, bit his Nails to the blood) having given them ſome ſuſpicion of the
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:60459:163"/>
truth, made them ſpeak lower; and then it was, that the <hi>Viceroy</hi> being upon Sentinel, and enrag'd at the heart, not knowing what their ſecret way of Diverſion might be, would fain have found ſome device or other to peep in upon them, tho' he could not well have hoped to ſee any thing there that might be very pleaſing to him.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Grand Maſter,</hi> who was under a violent impatience to ſee <hi>Donna Brigitta,</hi> could no longer defer his return. Thoſe who have never loved, are more violent than others, when they begin to be fired. He left his buſineſs half undone, and ſigh'd all the time of his abſence from her: He could have wiſhed for a winged Chariot, to bring him home ſo much the ſooner: But how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, at laſt he gets thither, and running directly to the Cloſet, he finds, not without great ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize, the <hi>Viceroy</hi> in a very ſad poſture, and with a Countenance which ſufficiently witneſs'd the Confuſion that poſſeſt him; at firſt he made a pleaſant judgment of it, and reaſon'd after this natural manner; What a Cur of a Hound, ſays he to himſelf, is this; no ſooner have I any Game here, but he is preſently noſing after it, however he ſeem'd as if he knew nothing, and told him, as he came up to him, that he was amazed to ſee him there alone, and ask'd him, if he knew where his Wife was. You may hear News of her, anſwers the <hi>Viceroy,</hi> in a Tone that ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently expreſt his Aſtoniſhment, if you will but open the Cloſet door. The <hi>Grand Maſter,</hi> who had the Key in his Pocket, would ſeem cunning, and having no deſire that the <hi>Viceroy</hi> ſhould ſee the fair <hi>Brigitta,</hi> whom he imagined to be the Perſon he ſought, knockt at the door, and deſired
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:60459:164"/>
his Wife to open it, telling her the <hi>Viceroy</hi> was there. She anſwer'd that ſhe could not, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſir'd to be excus'd. The <hi>Grand Maſter</hi> being glad of this anſwer, told <hi>Don Fernand</hi> that he muſt excuſe her this time, that perchance ſhe was do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſomething ſhe would be loath to have any men witneſſes of: I know, replies the <hi>Viceroy,</hi> that ſhe is doing ſomething belonging to her Sex, but it is ſuch as cannot be done without the aſſiſtance of a Man, and if you will perſwade her to open the door, you will ſee, ſhe could not have cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen one more gallant, or more young. I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand you, Sir, anſwered the <hi>Grand Maſter,</hi> ſmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling; but as he is, we will let him alone with her; and I hope you will not be more concern'd at it than I. No, I aſſure you, anſwer'd the <hi>Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roy:</hi> But <hi>Don Gabriel,</hi> (ſo the <hi>Grand Maſter</hi> was called) deceive not your ſelf, do you know who it is? I know him ſo well, anſwer'd the other, that I my ſelf lockt them in together, and that you may not doubt, purſues he, with an Air full of Raillery, ſee here the Key. <hi>Don Fernand,</hi> ſtrangely ſurpris'd to hear him ſpeak in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, was ſome time without giving him any an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer; and after having walkt two or three turns in the Chamber, looking him in the Face, as if he would read in his Countenance, whether he ſpoke in good earneſt: Your Temper, ſays he, for a Man of Honour as you are, in ſuch a Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance paſſes my underſtanding. What you pleaſe, anſwers <hi>Don Gabriel</hi> ſmiling ſtill; but all this ſhall not oblige me to ſhew you my Wife's Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant. I know him well enough, replies the <hi>Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roy.</hi> Since it is ſo, anſwer'd <hi>Don Gabriel,</hi> let us leave them in quiet together, for it is not the part
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:60459:164"/>
of a good natur'd Husband to interrupt his Wife's pleaſures, when ſhe is taking them with her Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant. The <hi>Viceroy,</hi> being more aſtoniſht, knew not what to ſay. He expected the <hi>Grand Maſter</hi>'s fury would have made him ſacrifice them both to his reſentment, and he was thinking with himſelf, if he could not divert him from it, at leaſt to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to ſave his Wife: How contrary was the Event to his expectation! He makes a Jeſt of it; he is agreed with them, and has made himſelf their Goaler. What can the amazed <hi>Don Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand</hi> imagine, but that the <hi>Grand Maſter</hi> has loſt his Wits, or that they have given him a Spell? He went his way, for he knew not how to deal with a Man of his Character, and looking upon him with ſcorn, he marched out of the Chamber: <hi>Don Gabriel</hi> waited on him: The <hi>Viceroy</hi> told him he ought to have more care of his Reputation; the other laughed at the advice, and anſwer'd him only in raillery. <hi>In fine</hi> the <hi>Viceroy</hi> left him with the worſt opininion one man could frame of another.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe that were in the cloſet had not heard all this dialogue without a great deal of concern; They had both been undone had the <hi>Viceroy</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded <hi>Don Gabriel</hi> to open the door; and they trembled when he came back to them: The ſiege being rais'd, at laſt, ſays he to them, this <hi>Viceroy</hi> would be a terrible man, if he did not find ſome others as cunning as himſelf; He told them all the diſcourſe they had had, but with ſuch mimical geſtures, as forc'd them almoſt to burſt with laughing, notwithſtanding the little incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation they had to it. This Comedy had laſted much longer, had not the Count, obſerving the
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:60459:165"/>
trouble <hi>Donna Angelica</hi> was in, occaſioned by the <hi>Viceroy,</hi> reſolved to retire.</p>
                  <p>But what gave them moſt trouble was, that <hi>Don Gabriel</hi> would by all means wait on them, and there was need of all their Rhetorick and addreſſes to divert him from it. The fair <hi>Donna Brigitta</hi> made uſe of all the power ſhe had over him; promiſing him that whenſoever ſhe came to Town, ſhe would come and paſs ſome time with them: So that at length he yielded to let her go, and ſhe without any further impediment got to the Ladies lodging, where ſhe changed her cloaths, and reaſſumed her former figure.</p>
                  <p>The next day <hi>Donna Angelica,</hi> impatient to hear news of the feign'd <hi>Brigitta,</hi> ſent a note, which by misfortune fell into the hands of <hi>Don Fernand,</hi> by means of one of his ſpys, which he had plac'd at <hi>Count Henry</hi>'s door, to obſerve what paſſed, to whom the meſſenger entruſted the note, taking him for one of the Counts ſervants. The <hi>Viceroy</hi> was reading it when he ſaw the <hi>Grand Maſter</hi> coming to ſpeak with him about ſome important buſineſs, and beginning to laugh, he ask'd him what news of his wives Gallant? they ſaid very pleaſant things to each other, both of them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving they had reaſon to be pleaſant on that ſubject. You are a man of good ſence, Seignior <hi>Don Gabriel,</hi> ſaid <hi>Don Fernand</hi> to him, we are not reſponſible for the follies our wives commit; and it is a madneſs to be diſquieted at them, or to make our reputation depend on them: how many men are there of your humour, and where are the husbands that are not ſubject to the like.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Grand Maſter,</hi> who ſaw the <hi>Viceroy</hi>'s rail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery went a little too far, I ſhall come to you, Sir,
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:60459:165"/>
ſays he, to comfort me in this caſe, when I have need of it; for you are prepar'd, I ſee, upon this ſubject: but let me tell you, it is no more true, that there was a Gallant yeſterday in the cloſet with my wife, than that there were theives there the other day. I agree with you in that; anſwers the <hi>Viceroy</hi> that the one is as true as the other. But, Sir, ſays <hi>Don Gabriel,</hi> the cloſet is not ſo large; I have eyes, and I think— I know you have eyes, interrupted <hi>Don Fernand,</hi> but I know too you will not make uſe of them. I told you it was a Domeſtick thief who ſought neither your mony, nor your other little Cloſet-knacks; but it ſeems you care not; ſince you are ſo good as to lock him in your ſelf with your wife. What! is that the thief, anſwer'd the <hi>Grand Maſter,</hi> with a violent laughter, which hinder'd him to purſue his diſcourſe. I wiſh, added he a little after, ſuch thieves would come every day; I will give them liberty to ſteal what they pleaſe. But Sir, to leave you no longer in your errour, I will tell you, the thief you ſpeak of is one of the handſom'ſt women in the Kingdom. A woman, replyes the <hi>Viceroy,</hi> laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as well as he, and ſince when is <hi>Count Henry</hi> become a woman? <hi>Count Henry,</hi> ſays <hi>Don Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briel!</hi> I think I have ſeen him; but he has not ſuch lineaments, (though this were poſſible) nor ſuch a complexion, nor ſuch a fine neck, nor I know, added he, I am not a man to be ſo deceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as to take a Man for a Woman: yet, ſays <hi>Don Fernand,</hi> it was the Count who was yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day in the cloſet with <hi>Donna Angelica,</hi> and the thief I mentioned the other day. What, the thief that I cudgeld, replys <hi>Don Gabriel.</hi> I ſpeak not
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:60459:166"/>
of the drubbs you gave a man the other night, anſwers the <hi>Viceroy,</hi> but what I have told you is very true. Sir, replys <hi>Don Gabriel,</hi> if my wife had a deſign of making any gallantry, ſhe would not ſure elect ſuch a raw young Gallant as he is. The youngeſt men are not the worſt Gallants, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd the <hi>Viceroy,</hi> and youth is ſeldom diſpleaſing in a way of gallantry, nay, more, I aſſure you, I know his voice too well to be deceiv'd. We are more eaſily deceived, replys the <hi>Grand Maſter</hi> by our ears, then our eyes. I ſee very well: And I too, ſayd <hi>Don Fernand,</hi> and to convince you fully, read this Note, which one of your wives Pages deliver'd this morning to a ſervant of mine, whom he took without doubt for another. <hi>Don Gabriel</hi> takes it, and finds in it theſe words.</p>

                  <p>This Note had no ſuperſcription, and <hi>Don Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briel,</hi> having read it, askt the <hi>Viceroy</hi> what he found in it, that reflected upon his honour, and how he knew it was addreſt to a Gallant, rather than to a Lady. I think it is enough to clear that doubt, anſwers <hi>Don Fernand,</hi> that it was
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:60459:166"/>
ſent to <hi>Count Henry;</hi> but for your ſake, added he, laughing, I will believe if you will have me, that it was to <hi>Donna Brigitta,</hi> whom the Note mentions. Well, replyes <hi>Don Gabriel,</hi> riſing to be gone, if I have no other enemies to fear, but the young <hi>Neapolitan,</hi> I hold my ſelf very ſecure on that ſide, as to my Wife.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Grand Maſter</hi> having thus left the <hi>Viceroy,</hi> came to his wives apartment, and askt her, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhe had writ any note that morning; ſhe, who readily ſuſpected the <hi>Viceroy</hi> of ſome trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery, anſwer'd him without any trouble, that ſhe had, and that it was to <hi>Donna Brigitta: Don Gabriel</hi> who would have ſworn for his wife's vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, believed what ſhe ſaid, ſhew'd her the letter the <hi>Viceroy</hi> had given him, and told her from the beginning to the end all the diſcourſe they had had together. Whereupon the incenſed <hi>Don<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na Angelica</hi> ſpoke all that her anger ſuggeſted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Don Fernand.</hi> She told <hi>Don Gabriel</hi> that which moſt troubled her, in the baſeneſs of the <hi>Viceroy</hi>'s actions, was, that not being contented to uſe all means to create an ill underſtanding be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them, he had to her greater diſhonour, charg'd her with a man whom all the Court knew to be the <hi>Vice-queens</hi> Gallant: And that you may not doubt it, added ſhe, beſides the report that runs abroad of it, I will ſhew you a letter which I found the other day by chance, in which you may ſee what the Lady writes to the Count. She went to the cloſet, and brought one her lover had ſacrificed to her, which he had received but two days before from the <hi>Vicequeen.</hi> The <hi>Grand Maſter</hi> read it with an inexpreſſable joy, that he had ſomewhat to inſult over the <hi>Viceroy</hi> withall:
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:60459:167"/>
He went inſtantly to find him out, and, accoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him with a ſmiling countenance, Sir, ſays he, I know not what day this is, but all love-meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers are deſtined to miſtakes on it: <hi>Count Henry</hi> has more then one miſtreſs; a while ſince one of your men ſurpris'd a note which my wife writ to him, and ſee here another which is fallen in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the hands of one of my ſervants, and which one of the <hi>Vice-queen</hi>'s Pages carry'd to the ſame Gallant. Some miſtake on both ſides; but as you had the goodneſs to deliver me that of my wives, I thought my ſelf obliged to bring you this from yours. Take it, Sir, added he, you know the character, I think it is your Ladys. It is ſo, anſwer'd the <hi>Viceroy</hi> coldly, and began to read.</p>

<pb n="313" facs="tcp:60459:167"/>
like your ſelf; like me, Sir, replys the <hi>Grand-Maſter</hi> then, methinks my wives Letter ſhould ſpeak ſo as that does of the <hi>Vice-queens,</hi> but there is a great deal of difference betwixt them. That difference is juſt nothing, anſwers <hi>Don Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand,</hi> and I tell you, though our wives do not write the ſame, they uſe us both in the ſame manner. Sir, replys the <hi>Grand Maſter,</hi> if you are willing to believe ſo for your own com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, I will ſubſcribe to it: but raillery apart, I know what I ought to think, and till you have ſhew'd me as convincing proofs as I bring you, you will give me leave, upon the ſubject of our Wives, to put a difference between your fortune, and mine. The <hi>Viceroy</hi> told him it would not be difficult to convince him, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided he will believe his eyes; and <hi>Don Gabriel</hi> having promis'd he would contribute on his part to the diſcovery as much as he could, they part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the <hi>Viceroy</hi> being reſolv'd not to leave one ſtone unturn'd, to be revenged of the incredulity of the husband, and treachery of the wife; The <hi>Grand Maſter</hi> deſigning to let him uſe his endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, without giving any notice of it to his wife, of whoſe loyalty he thought he had no reaſon to entertain the leaſt ſuſpicion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Count Henry,</hi> whom <hi>Donna Angelica</hi> had not fail'd to acquaint with all that had paſſed between the <hi>Viceroy,</hi> and <hi>Don Gabriel,</hi> went no more to her apartment: but they could not be long with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſeeing each other. They made ſeveral aſſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, of which very few ſucceeded according to their wiſh<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> having always found ſome that follow'd them, or gave them ſome interruption. They were obſerv'd not only by the <hi>Viceroy</hi> and
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:60459:168"/>
the <hi>Grand Maſter,</hi> but by the <hi>Vice-queen</hi> alſo; who, ſome Days ſince, became more jealous of the Count than ever, becauſe ſhe ſaw him but ſeldom; and caus'd him to be dogged from Morning to Night, and follow'd him ſometimes her ſelf. The Palace Garden had been more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable to them than any other Place, whether for the Convenience <hi>Donna Angelica</hi> had of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thither without Noiſe, or without being fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd; or that it was not miſtruſted, being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways kept carefully lock't. But it is dangerous to go often to one and the ſame Place, and in Caſe of an Amour, the ſureſt way is often to change Stations.</p>
                  <p>This Garden was one of the pleaſanteſt of <hi>Catalo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> the chief Country of delicate Gardens. There was in the Middle of it, a kind of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanted Palace, made of Trees artificially rang'd, and compos'd into Galleries, Halls, Chambers, and Cloſets, with all their Appurtenances, one of the moſt curious Pieces of Art in the World. There was but one way into this Palace of Trees, which was by a Drawbridge, it being ſurrounded with a deep Mote full of Water. The Thought of paſſing an Hour or two of the Night in ſo pleaſant a Place, no ſooner preſented it ſelf to our Lovers, but they found means to get falſe Keys to the Garden-door. The <hi>Viceroy</hi> had at length ſome Notice of it, and advis'd the <hi>Grand Maſter,</hi> the better to ſurprize them, to tell his Wife, that he was to make a Journey into the Country for two or three Days. <hi>Don Gabriel,</hi> who could not yet believe what he heard, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to what he deſired of him. The Spies were ſent into the Garden early, who immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:60459:168"/>
got up into the Trees to keep ſentinel. It was ſcarce Night, when they ſaw a Man, of a very good Preſence, walk towards the green Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, and within a little while after, a brisk jolly Lady, who took the ſame way. They ſtole down from the Trees, having no more to do, and having drawn up the Bridge, according to their Orders, they ran preſently to the <hi>Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roy,</hi> to acquaint him that they had taken the Quarry. What a Joy was this to <hi>Don Fernand: Don Gabriel</hi> was neither merry nor ſad. He de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to know the Truth, and then he knew what Reſolution to take, if things were ſo as they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported. Now the Truth will appear, ſays the <hi>Viceroy,</hi> but I muſt beg a Favour of you, which is, that you would not be tranſported againſt your Wife, and that you will content your ſelf with putting the Gallant into the Hands of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice. I believe, anſwers the <hi>Grand Maſter,</hi> that in ſuch Affairs we do not take Counſel of any Perſons, but tell me what you would do your ſelf, ſhould it happen to be your Wife. I would ſhut her up in a Convent, reply'd the <hi>Viceroy,</hi> or ſend her back to her Friends, and I beg that Favour at your Hands, for <hi>Donna Angelica:</hi> For I proteſt to you, I ſhall not endure to ſee a Woman ill us'd for a Misfortune which ſhe ſhould always have reaſon to accuſe me of; ſhew her me, Sir, ſays <hi>Don Gabriel,</hi> and then it will be time enough to interceed for her; but to tell you the Truth, my Heart, which uſes to give me the firſt Alarm, when any ill Accident threatens me, does not yet give me the leaſt Commotion. <hi>Don Fernand</hi> begins to laugh, and without any further Reply, marches towards the Garden, and
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:60459:169"/>
                     <hi>Don Gabriel</hi> follow'd him, being each of them attended by five or ſix Servants well armed, to apprehend the Gallant.</p>
                  <p>They entred the Garden: The Night was ſo dark, they could hardly ſee each other; they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced towards the Place, cauſed the Bridge to be gently let down, where having commanded their Servants to tarry, that they might make the leſs Noiſe, and withall not to have them for Witneſſes of this Adventure: Only they two went in, and ſoftly ſtole towards the green Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace. But it being of a large Extent, and having a thouſand Places wherein to skulk, it was hard in this Obſcurity, to find thoſe they ſought. The <hi>Viceroy</hi> marcht before, and he would have been pleas'd that <hi>Don Gabriel</hi> ſhould hear part of the Diſcourſe between the two Lovers, not any longer to doubt of the Title with which his Wife honoured him. I believe it would have been a pleaſant thing to have ſeen two Perſons of their Character, animated each by different Motions, marching on Tiptoe in the dark, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times liſtning, and taking even the Noiſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves made for the Voice of ſome body; parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly the <hi>Viceroy,</hi> who intereſſed himſelf ſo much in this Affair, that the moving of the leaſt Leaf gave him an Alarm: They held each other by the Hand, as the Song is; and <hi>Don Fernand</hi> having the Vandguard, was the firſt who met with one; but inſtead of catching, he was caught himſelf. He had ſcarce entred one of the Rooms, where he had heard ſome Noiſe, but he was ſeiz'd by the Arm. Moſt treacherous of all Men, ſays the Perſon that held him, and whom he knew, by her Voice, to be his own Wife,
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:60459:169"/>
will you now own your Treachery, or will you yet tell me you come hither to ſeek me? I leave it to the Reader to judge whether the <hi>Viceroy</hi> were not ſufficiently aſtoniſht, he knew not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhe ſpoke to him in earneſt, or whether ſhe took him for another: But for <hi>Don Gabriel</hi> 'tis hard to expreſs his Joy: Ah wretch! con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinu'd ſhe, could you after all my Kindneſs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray me in this manner? What Pleaſure could you take in abuſing me with a Belief that you loved me, was it only to comply with the <hi>Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roy,</hi> who choſe you to be my Gallant? Why do you not ſpeak to me? I ſhould have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to have given you a Miſtreſs as I did, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out giving you a Heart which you refuſe. Theſe Words were too clear to leave the aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed <hi>Don Fernand</hi> in any Doubt. He would have retir'd, full of Confuſion, with what he had heard; not ſo much upon her account, as <hi>Don Gabriel</hi>'s, who kept cloſe to him behind, and would needs ſee the End of this Scene, which could not but be exceeding pleaſant; but before we paſs any farther, it will not be amiſs, for the better underſtanding of this Adventure, to tell you, how the <hi>Vice-queen</hi> happen'd to be there that Night.</p>
                  <p>I have already ſpoke of her Jealouſie, which for ſome Days before tormented her, and caus'd her to obſerve all the Motions of the Count, and ſometimes follow'd him in Perſon. She had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, as well as the <hi>Viceroy,</hi> that he went every Night into the Garden, and not doubting but it was to ſee <hi>Donna Angelica</hi> there in private; ſhe went thither by Night diſguis'd in Man's Appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel, to the end ſhe might not be known. The
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:60459:170"/>
Palace of Trees being the fitteſt Place for an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terview, ſhe judged they had made choice of it for theirs: So that ſhe went thither to wait for them, and a while after ſaw <hi>Donna Angelica</hi> come towards the Place; but it being the Count whom ſhe principally ſought, ſhe let her paſs without Interruption. It is true, that in the Impetuoſity of her firſt Motions, when ſhe was near her, ſhe had like to have been tranſported to ſome Action, more conformable to her Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie, than her Sex.</p>
                  <p>The Spies, as I have already told you, went immediately to give the <hi>Viceroy</hi> notice: And the Count being come thither preſently after, was much aſtoniſht to ſee the Bridge drawn. He imagin'd there was ſome Myſtery in it: He went round the Moat, to try whether he could hear any Noiſe, which might give him ſome further Knowledge of that Accident.

<pb n="319" facs="tcp:60459:170"/>
was for her part ſtrangely perplext. At firſt ſhe was much ſurpriz'd to hear the <hi>Vice-queen</hi> ſpeak in a Place where ſhe not only thought no body was, but where ſhe ſo little expected her. She roſe up at the Noiſe the <hi>Viceroy</hi> and the <hi>Grand Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter</hi> made, thinking it was the Count, and was going towards them, when on a ſudden ſhe heard the Voice of her Rival, reproaching her Lover: She was ſeized with Fear, and knew not what to undertake in ſo extraordinary an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Vice-queen,</hi> who knew that <hi>Donna An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelica</hi> was in that Place, ſpoke in this manner to the falſe Count, on purpoſe to oblige him to an Anſwer, ſuch as ſhe deſir'd <hi>Donna Angelica</hi> ſhould hear. Speak, ungrateful Man, purſued ſhe, ſeeing he made no Anſwer; What do you find in <hi>Donna Angelica</hi> more than in me! Is it that ſhe is falſe as you are? As for her Wit or her Beauty, you know us both too well to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer her to me. Will you tell me, it is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge me on the <hi>Viceroy?</hi> No, it is nothing but the Pleaſure you take in Treachery, that could engage you: For you will not deny but you have lov'd me with Paſſion, and have told me a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand times, that if I pleas'd, you would no more ſee that Lady, and that you had not the leaſt Inclination to her: And in the mean time, while I give my Heart entirely to you, and you aſſure me of yours, you caſt your ſelf upon a Woman whom you profeſs not to love.</p>
                  <p>In all this there was ſomething pleaſing, and ſomething diſagreeable to both the Husbands. When any thing was ſaid that diſpleas'd <hi>Don Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand,</hi> he made a ſtep back, and the other puſht
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:60459:171"/>
him forwards; when it was any thing that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected on <hi>Don Gabriel,</hi> the <hi>Viceroy</hi> pull'd him back by the Cloak. I have not yet done, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſues the <hi>Vice-queen,</hi> ſeeing he ſtill kept ſilence, you ſhall not part from me till you have decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red which of us two, <hi>Donna Angelica</hi> or I, reigns Empreſs in your heart. I know it muſt be I, added ſhe; if you follow the <hi>Viceroy</hi>'s Counſel; for you know there is no Woman he could love above me, if I were not his own Wife already. But follow the dictates of your own heart, and tell me whether you deceive us both, or if I be the only deceived perſon. You only, Madam, anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer'd the <hi>Viceroy,</hi> in whom the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> flegm be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to take fire; you are doubly deceived, purſues he, both in taking me for the Count, and in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwading your ſelf that he loves you. You did not, purſued he, think me ſo near you, when you made me acquainted with your Affairs. No, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, anſwers ſhe, in a great aſtoniſhment, which nevertheleſs ſhe ſoon overcame, but I am not angry that you heard what I have ſaid, for you know whether you have not deſerv'd all this, and whether any one has contributed to your diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour more than your ſelf. All this, replies he, might be better told if I were alone; but here is the <hi>Grand Maſter,</hi> replies the <hi>Vice-queen</hi> to him, has too great a ſhare in this Evenings Adventure to laugh alone; and if he will give himſelf the trouble of ſearching all theſe Rooms, he will find a Lady of his acquaintance here who came not hither to meet with him: <hi>Donna Angelica</hi> who was not far off, heard this Diſcourſe, and I leave you to judge what her apprehenſions were. The <hi>Grand Maſter,</hi> who knew it was his Wife the
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:60459:171"/>
                     <hi>Vice-queen</hi> ſpoke of, did but laugh, not ſeeing any probability of her being there; and anſwer'd her, that he did not conceive the Rendevous was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for two Ladies, ſince there was but one Gallant. It is true, anſwer'd the Lady, but the aſſignation was made for <hi>Donna Angelica.</hi> Then, Madam, reply'd <hi>Don Gabriel,</hi> what brought you hither? The ſame, anſwers ſhe, that brought you, though my Succeſs has been as bad as yours. But, Madam, ſays <hi>Don Gabriel</hi> to her, you ſee I have no reaſon to give credit to what you ſay, ſince by your own confeſſion, you are jealous of my Wife; nevertheleſs if you can ſhew her to me here, I ſhall then believe you. The <hi>Vice-queen</hi> having told him, he need but ſearch the place. The <hi>Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roy,</hi> ſent ſome of his Servants to the Palace for Lights, though ſhe endeavour'd to oppoſe it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unwilling to be ſeen in the Equipage ſhe was in: But notwithſtanding, the Order was given, and they ſtrait ran to the Palace, to fetch ſome Flambeau's.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Don Fernand</hi> had no reaſon to be very well ſatisfied with the <hi>Vice-queen;</hi> though beſides his not loving her, he ſaw, that to give true Juſtice to all Perſons, the fault lay not wholly at her door; and that it was but juſt he ſhould ſuffer for his own folly: Yet, notwithſtanding all theſe Reaſons that made againſt him, and of which he endeavour'd to convince himſelf, he could not but be exceeding vext to think <hi>Don Gabriel</hi> was wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his ſhame. It was neceſſary to make the Scales even, that he ſhould ſhew him <hi>Donna Angelica;</hi> and he dyed with impatience to have the Lights brought. This unfortunate Lady was in the greateſt perplexity imaginable; ſhe had
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:60459:172"/>
hid her ſelf under the Buſhes, but when ſhe heard them talk of Lights, ſhe thought there was no place of ſecurity for her; ſhe would have made her eſcape, but ſhe found the Bridge guarded. What courſe to take ſhe knew not; ſhe walkt round the Moat with tears in her Eyes, demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Night to redouble her darkneſs, to ſave her from the unhappineſs that threatned her; and ſhe was reſolved rather to throw her ſelf in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Water ſhe ſaw before her, then to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to the laughter and ſcorn of her moſt cruel Enemies: When on a ſudden ſhe diſcovers thro' that obſcurity the end of a Plank, which reſted on the bank of the Moat where ſhe ſtood. She was fearful at firſt, but taking courage by little and little, examin'd what it was, and could not imagine from whence that ſuccour came: She ſtuck not to venture her ſelf upon it, and try to paſs to the other ſide; but ſhe was ſcarce half<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, when ſhe met a Man coming towards her upon the ſame Plank: Her fear redoubled, and ſhe was juſt upon the point to return back, had ſhe not been ſtopt by the voice of that Perſon, who askt, Is it you, Madam? Ah my dear Count, anſwer'd ſhe, with an incredible Joy, how opportunely has Heaven ſent you, to free me from the greateſt Misfortunes that could be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fal me. The Count, (for it was he) gave her his Hand, and told her, he had been above an hour ſeeking ſome means to relieve her, and that by a great goodneſs of Fortune, he had found that Plank at the lower end of all the Garden.</p>
                  <p>Their Diſcourſe was not long, the time would not permit it, the Lights of the <hi>Viceroy</hi> had ſent for, appear'd already in the Green Palace. They
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:60459:172"/>
drew away their Plank, and having tumbled it into the Moat, they got by a by-way, preſently to the Gate, at which they were uſed to come in, to think how to manage their Affairs, and ſecure themſelves from their jealous Obſervers. As they paſt, they could perceive the other three very buſie in Search of the fair Fugitive. There was not a Hole or Corner in the Palace, which they left unviſited: Not a Buſh unſhaken, and hardly any of the higher Graſs unſearcht: In fine, no Place, though never ſo abſtruſe, which was not carefully examin'd, as well by the M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſters as the Spies themſelves: Who all affirm'd they had ſeen two Perſons enter the green Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, and the <hi>Vice-queen</hi> more poſitively than they, added for the further Credit of the Story, that it was <hi>Donna Angelica,</hi> whom ſhe had ſeen, toucht, and follow'd for ſome time.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Grand Maſter,</hi> as he had reaſon, laught at all this: And even took Pleaſure in making them run from one ſide to the other, to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, the <hi>Vice-queen</hi> was abſolutely in the laſt Deſpair, and proteſted ſhe would not quit the Garden till ſhe had found <hi>Angelica.</hi> You will find, ſays <hi>Don Gabriel,</hi> continuing his Railery, that this dangerous Count has carry'd her away; for you muſt needs confeſs with me, that a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man being alone, and without Help, cannot otherwiſe than by Enchantment, get out of this Place, the Bridge being drawn. They had great Conteſts on both ſides, which at laſt ended in the common Confuſion, both of the <hi>Viceroy</hi> and his Lady, who being weary at length with their unpofitable Search, took their way to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace. <hi>Don Fernand,</hi> nevertheleſs, commanded that the Bridge ſhould remain drawn all the
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:60459:173"/>
Night, and that Guard ſhould be kept, intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the next Morning to renew the Search. To what end, ſays the <hi>Grand Maſter,</hi> is all this Precaution, but to cheriſh ſo many idle Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of your own Brain: Sometimes a Thief is in my Wife's Cloſet, another time a Gallant transform'd into the Country Lady, and now to conclude all theſe Adventures, I am to find my Wife, by Night in the Garden with <hi>Count Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;</hi> where, inſtead of her, I met with yours, who takes you for that young Gallant. What ought I to infer from all this, added he, but that you were pleas'd to give me the Diverſion of a Comedy which we will conclude, if you pleaſe, in my Wife's Chamber, whom doubtleſs we ſhall find aſleep, whilſt you have given your ſelf ſo much Trouble in ſearching for her here. The <hi>Viceroy,</hi> whoſe Head was full of what his Spies had told him, and of which he doubted not, ſince his Wife had confirmed it, took him at his word, and went with him towards his Apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>As for the <hi>Vice-queen,</hi> ſhe had left them in a great diſpute which of the two was graced with the Largeſt Antlers.</p>
                  <p>They came into the Palace, and meet in the Guard-room the <hi>Major</hi> of the place, who waited for the <hi>Viceroy</hi> to deliver him the keys of the Town-gates, and told him, that <hi>Count Henry</hi> was juſt gone forth at one of the gates of the Haven, and had embarqued himſelf with a very hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom Lady whom he led with him. A Lady, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plys the <hi>Viceroy</hi> looking on <hi>Don Gabriel,</hi> to obſerve his countenace: You will find, ſays the <hi>Grand Maſter</hi> to him laughing; it is ſhe whom we ſeek.
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:60459:173"/>
The <hi>Viceroy,</hi> without giving any anſwer to the <hi>Grand Maſters</hi> raillery, askt the <hi>Major</hi> of what ſtature ſhe was. But he could give no exact ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, becauſe they walk't faſt, and gave him but little time to obſerve them. The <hi>Viceroy</hi>'s heart notwithſtanding, miſgave him that it was no other than <hi>Donna Angelica:</hi> and running to her apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to know the truth, he found in effect that ſhe was abſent, and came preſently with the news to her incredulous husband, hoping he would loſe no time in purſuit of her. <hi>Don Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briel</hi> was for the preſent a little aſtoniſht at it; but like a man of ſence, by the <hi>Viceroy</hi>'s example, he would not afflict himſelf overmuch, and told him, that ſince his Wife was not as ſhe ought to be, the Count had done him a favour, ridding him of her: ſo that the poor <hi>Viceroy</hi> being af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted on both ſides, and made a Cuckold too in the bargain, fell to conſider what he ſhould do with his own Wife; but he found his condition common to ſo many husbands, that comforting himſelf with others in the like circumſtance, he reſolved not to part with her, and I think he did well.</p>

                  <head>THE HAPPY SLAVE, A Novel.</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>AFRICK,</hi> for ſome Ages, hath paſt for a part of the World, where the People were no leſs Cruel and Savage than the Lions and Tygers that fill the Deſarts of that Countrey: But ſince the diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of Love there, it hath appear'd, that as Love grows in all Countreys, ſo <hi>Barbary</hi> it ſelf hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of Barbarous but the Name. To verifie this, I ſhall entertain you with a piece of Gallan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy acted there, which may juſtifie what I affirm.</p>
                  <p>Count <hi>ALEXANDER,</hi> a young <hi>Roman</hi> Lord, very conſiderable for Eſtate, (but more for Birth and Parts,) had ſcarce appear'd to act his part on the great Theatre of the World, but he found himſelf preſt by his Relations to Marry: He was handſom, high ſpirited, and witty, as thoſe of Old <hi>Rome,</hi> but addicted to Pleaſure, as thoſe of the New; humourſome, and wholly given up to the purſuit of his Fancy and Inclinations. As for Marriage (upon the good Advice he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:60459:179"/>
not to engage, but as late as he could,) he uſually ſaid, <hi>What a pitiful Utenſil a Wife is?</hi> wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs the greateſt part of thoſe Gentlemen dignified with the Illuſtrious Title of Husbands; eſpecially now adays, when Men ſeem to have Wives onely for this, That others may make uſe of them.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Conſequences he drew, as well from Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience as Example; for being Young, Handſom, and Rich; he was ſufficiently qualified not to fail of good Fortune, with a Sex (in our Age) very kind and ſuſceptible, and had not wanted his diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſements of that Nature; and therefore he had ſmall inclination by taking a Wife, to give others the Opportunity to pay him in his own Coin.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time the Intereſts of the Family (which often prove Poiſon to the greateſt pleaſures of Life (obliging the moſt excellent Perſons to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Actions: The Young <hi>Roman,</hi> to deliver himſelf from the importunity of Relations, choſe rather to quit the Pleaſures of <hi>ROME,</hi> by Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling abroad, than to make himſelf ſubject to a Law ſo contrary to his Humour, and that beloved Liberty he preferred before all things. He com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated his deſign to his <hi>Valett de Chambre,</hi> who had ſerved him long, and being active and ingenious, quickly took order to have all things in readineſs that were neceſſary for their purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>The Spring was come, and the Weather ſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able for Travel, when on a fair day the Young Gentleman and his Servant privately left <hi>Rome,</hi> and imbarqued at <hi>Civita Vecchia</hi> in a <hi>Felucca</hi> hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for the purpoſe. His deſign was to viſit the beſt Courts of <hi>Europe,</hi> beginning with that of <hi>Spain.</hi> But there are Perſons over whom Fortune is ſo rigorouſly imperious, that ſhe ſeems jealous
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:60459:179"/>
of any thing they undertake, without conſulting her firſt. 'Twas ſhe who provided Count <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> a Voyage into <hi>Africk,</hi> when he had deſigned to confine his Travels to <hi>Europe:</hi> Of the Towns he was to ſee, <hi>Tunis</hi> was marked out by Fortune for one; and though much out of his Road, yet where Fortune intermeddles, there always happens ſomething extraordinary; her exceſſes and extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagancies being that which chiefly makes us take notice of her.</p>
                  <p>The fourth day after he had left <hi>Civita Vecchia,</hi> this Young Lord began to perceive, that though all the Elements are terrible at Sea, yet Men who are Enemies are more terrible than the Elements. Till then the Weather had been fair to extremity, not a puff of contrary Wind: He proceeded in his Voyage with what ſpeed he could wiſh, and bleſſed himſelf at the happineſs of the Weather.</p>
                  <p>The Coaſt of <hi>Italy</hi> is dangerous, eſpecially in Summer, being then ſubject to In-roads by People of the South, whoſe livelihood is Robbery; and when the Weather is fair, their Trade is ſo great, that whoſoever is not upon his Guard, is happy if he eſcape them; I mean the Corſairs of <hi>Barbary.</hi> Count <hi>Alexander,</hi> who never thought he had left <hi>Rome,</hi> to be led in Triumph to <hi>Tunis,</hi> ſaw himſelf at break of day ſaluted by a <hi>Brigandine</hi> of that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: The poor Seamen preſently took <hi>Alarm,</hi> the ſight of one Turban was ſufficient to affright them: And the <hi>Turks</hi> had ſcarce diſcharged three or four Muſquets at the Chriſtians, but they leapt into the Sea to ſave themſelves by ſwimming; the <hi>Italian</hi> Count and his Servant ſtaid in the Veſſel, not in hopes of being able to defend themſelves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt that number of Enemies, which the ſtrength
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:60459:180"/>
of <hi>Rollando,</hi> and the Inchanted Armour of <hi>Amadis</hi> could ſcarcely have done, (whereas now a Man is but a Man, and among other Secrets that of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanting Arms is loſt.) But having no skill in ſwimming, he could not expect to eſcape as the Mariners: Yet he was not ſo out of love with his Life, but that he held it better to be a Slave than be drowned. But that thoſe Barbarous Corſairs might ſee what a Perſon they dealt with, and that he might ſell his Liberty as dear as poſſible; hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing commanded his Servant to throw his Baggage over-board, he gave him order what further to do. I will omit the Deſcription of the Action, though reputed the moſt glorious ever done on the <hi>Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terranean,</hi> being a Combat of Two againſt Thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, whereof they laid ſix dead on the Deck, and many more wounded. 'Twas an Engagement of a Herd of Wolves againſt Two young Lions, who defended themſelves with unparallel'd Valour and Courage. 'Tis true, the <hi>Turks</hi> (not to loſe the Money they did expect from their Ranſom) ſpared them at firſt, uſing Cudgels only againſt them; but at length the Blood and Death of their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rades, and the ſhame and diſdain they had of ſo long and obſtinate defence made by two raſh Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians againſt them, being ſo many, having filled them with rage, they had recourſe to their Symitars: And with ſo much advantage, that having killed the <hi>Valet,</hi> the Young Count (after ſeveral Wounds received, his ſtrength, not his Courage, having failed him in ſo tedious a Fight,) was forced to yield, being no longer able to lift up his Arm to make uſe of his Sword. The Cowardly Villains had ſcarce the Courage to board him, and durſt not approach him, till they ſaw him fallen flat on his
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:60459:180"/>
back. They took him, and carried him on board their <hi>Brigandine,</hi> where they gave him all the help in their power for ſaving his Life, having no other mark of their Victory, but the taking one Valiant Perſon, who had coſt them too dear to be proud of their Prize: They beheld him with Admiration, and could not comprehend how an Age ſo tender could be capable of ſo much Courage; and that in a Body appearing ſo delicate, there was ſtrength enough lodged to perform the actions they had ſeen. And being Naturally Superſtitious, they did really believe there was ſomething ſupernatural in the Young Man's Perſon, or at leaſt, that he was the Flower of Chriſtendom; this conceit helped them to bear with more patience the ſhame of their Victory. And finding their Men thin, and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taken before ſome conſiderable Prizes, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to return directly for <hi>Tunis.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Weather was favourable, and in few days ſail they arrived at <hi>Gouletta,</hi> where going aſhore they put the poor Count on Horſe-back, bound and pinion'd like a Robber, and brought him to the Town; ſome of theſe <hi>Barbarians</hi> having got the ſtart of the reſt, ſpread ſuch a Report of his Valour and Courage, that they drew together not the ordinary People only, (who are curious of ſmall matters) but the Principal Perſons of <hi>Tunis,</hi> and the <hi>Baſſa</hi> himſelf, who accompanyed with many of his Friends, came walking towards the Ruines of <hi>Carthage,</hi> to ſee the arrival of this Famous Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, whom they imagined a Man that carried Terror in his looks: But how were they ſurpriz'd to ſee a Youth pale and disfigured, yet keeping with his good mien the marks of Grandeur in his Countenance. He was pityed by all, and the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:60459:181"/>
                     <hi>Baſſa</hi> being a gallant and generous Perſon, was preſently ſeized with ſuch Indignation againſt the Villains, who uſed in that manner one ſo little deſerving it, that he commanded them forthwith on pain of his diſpleaſure to unbind him upon the place; which they inſtantly did, not daring to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obey him, who next the <hi>Dey</hi> was of greateſt Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and Power in the Kingdom: He asked them the price of their Slave, and, having com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded him to be conducted to his Palace, paid the Corſairs five hundred Patacoons, being the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney they demanded.</p>
                  <p>Count <hi>Alexander</hi> having happily fallen into the hands of ſo good and generous a Patron, began to recover He was Lodged in a handſom Apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, where the <hi>Baſſa</hi>'s Chyrurgions ſearched his Wounds: And being more carefully lookt to than on board the <hi>Brigandine,</hi> he ſoon found himſelf better, though weak, and ſore bruiſed by what he had ſuffer'd at Sea from the hands of thoſe <hi>Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians,</hi> who having no pity for any, had not been too careful of him; yet there was no danger of his Life, the Fever he had was not great, and they had hopes to ſee him well in few days. The <hi>Baſſa</hi> vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited him Morning and Evening, and by degrees his care and kindneſs grew to that height, that he came more frequently to ſee him, and not only took more particular notice of him, but increaſed daily the eſteem and friendſhip he had for him.</p>
                  <p>Before I proceed, it may not be amiſs to ſatisfie the Curioſity of the Reader, in giving him an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Perſon; the Birth and Character of the <hi>Baſſa. Mahomet Baſſa</hi> by the Father of <hi>Sidy Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat,</hi> and <hi>Mahomet Lapſy</hi> the new Beys, was the Son of a Renegado of <hi>Corſica,</hi> of the Family of <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troſanty,</hi>
                     <pb n="7" facs="tcp:60459:181"/>
who by the handſomneſs of his Perſon, and the excellency of his Wit, having gained the good Opinion of the <hi>Dey</hi> or King of the Country, made ſo good uſe of the favour of his Prince, that he advanced him to the higheſt Office of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, whereof he left his Son <hi>Mahomet</hi> his Heir. But, to ſhorten the Story, <hi>Mahomet</hi> the younger being deeply embroyled with the <hi>Dey</hi> and the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>van,</hi> (who, jealous of the Authority his Father had gain'd, would have divided the Offices of <hi>Baſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa</hi> and <hi>Bey</hi>) went to the Port, and returned Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious: <hi>Tunis</hi> never flouriſhed as under him, being as fit for Arms as Gallantry, of a great Spirit, and excellent Wit, the moſt Brave, the moſt Generous and Magnificent of Men: He loved the Chriſtians, and did them Juſtice; and entertained a Commerce of Civility with many Princes of <hi>Europe.</hi> He ſent and receiv'd Preſents every Year to and from the Great Duke of <hi>Tuſcany;</hi> in a word, no Lord of that Country ever carried himſelf better, and had more Merit and Reputation than he: Some reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of this Splendor may yet be ſeen in the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of <hi>Mahomet Lapſy</hi> his Son; he had inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons worthy a great Lord, as he was, and the Soul of a Man truly Generous, and of Eminent Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Baſſa</hi> was charm'd with admiration at the Wit of the Count, extremely pleaſed with his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, and ſometimes paſt three or four hours in familiar Diſcourſe, ſitting on his Bed. He was chiefly ſurprized to find his Apprehenſion ſo clear, and Knowledge ſo general, that what Subject ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver he choſe to Diſcourſe of he ſpoke of to admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. This made the <hi>Baſſa</hi> ſpeak of him to his Friends with ſo tender Affection, and ſo much to
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:60459:182"/>
his Praiſe, that he gain'd him the Eſteem and Ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of all the principal Lords of the Kingdom, who came to ſee him, and made him Preſents according to the Cuſtom of the Country.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Baſſa,</hi> by many Illuſtrious marks and clear diſcoveries, was induced to believe the Count a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of no ordinary Quality, but did not think fit to queſtion him on that point; and had no further knowledge of him than that he was an <hi>Italian.</hi> Nor durſt the Count acquaint him with his Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, fearing, the knowing of it might make his Enlargement the more difficult: But after ſo many favours from the <hi>Baſſa,</hi> he could not in gratitude conceal himſelf from a Perſon who had obliged him ſo highly, and to whom he did owe more than his Life. Therefore being askt by the <hi>Baſſa,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his Parents were living, and why he writ not to them: <hi>Sir</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>I ſhould be the baſeſt of Men ſhould I ever forget the Obligations you have put upon me, nor could I be guilty of a greater diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honeſty, than to be prevail'd upon by fear, or any other conſideration, not to pay you what I owe you. I confeſs, (and I hope you will pardon me,) that I ſcrupled to make a full diſcovery of my ſelf to you, for fear my Captivity might be the harder, my Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage more ſevere, and my Liberty valued at a high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er rate: But having found you ſo generous, I cannot, after the Favours you have heaped upon me, the Rights you have over your Slaves, by forbearing to tell you, I am a Perſon of Quality, of one of the beſt Families of</hi> Rome; <hi>that my Name is</hi> Count Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander, <hi>and that if ever you reſtore me to my Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, I muſt pay you my Ranſom with moſt grateful Acknowledgments of your Kindneſs and Favours.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="9" facs="tcp:60459:182"/>The <hi>Baſſa</hi> ſmil'd, and with much tenderneſs an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd, <hi>Alexander, you ſhall not fare the worſe for your diſcovery to me; I am no Merchant of Slaves, nor did I buy you to ſell you again: You are free, and ſhall live with me in this Country as if you were in your own, with one of your Friends: And if I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain you here a little longer than perhaps you would wiſh, it is becauſe I can hardly part with one for whom I have ſo high an eſteem, and ſo cordial af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</hi> To theſe he added other expreſſions of Kindneſs, which were joyfully received by the Count, and diſpelled all his Grief for the loſs of his Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
                  <p>As ſoon as he had recovered his Strength, the <hi>Baſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa</hi> made him partake of his Pleaſures and Divertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, in Hunting, Walking, Horſe-race; in all which the Count appeared Eminent above others, and became more Famous than ever any Chriſtian was in thoſe Parts; every conſiderable Perſon was ambitious to viſit him, and took pleaſure to ſee, and to treat him, which is a ſpecial favour to thoſe of their Country, much more to one who profeſs'd a Religion, to which they are open irreconcileable Enemies. Hence you may obſerve the Power of Merit, and how irreſiſtable are influences of a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate Deſtiny. The eſteem the <hi>Baſſa</hi> expreſs'd publickly for him, contributed much to all theſe advantages; but you are to conſider his Perſon, and the ſweetneſs of his Temper, and candor of his Actions as the effectual means for gaining him Amity, and that which won him the Love of the moſt Excellent Perſons.</p>
                  <p>But notwithſtanding his Illuſtrious Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and agreeable Divertiſements, the Honours and Favours he daily received, he could not forbear
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:60459:183"/>
wiſhing with ſighs for a return into <hi>Europe.</hi> He lived as one free, but was really a Slave to the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of the <hi>Baſſa,</hi> from which he thought his deliverance more difficult, than from Fetters and Chains. His Wit and Inclnations were not for the Men of that Countrey; he loathed, and was weary of them: The <hi>Turks</hi> have a good ſenſe, and will reaſon well enough of the Affairs of the World, and are great and ſubtile Polititians; but for Wit and good Breeding, they know not what it is; their Converſation is barren, and conſiſts more in the ſmoak of Tobacco than Excellent Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe: Their Knowledge is ſmall, having ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily no advantage of Reading or Travel. The <hi>Baſſa</hi> alone had more Wit, and more Reaſon than the reſt altogether; but his Employment in the State engaging him in a thouſand indiſpenſible Affairs, would not allow him to be always with <hi>Alexander,</hi> who in the mean time paſt his Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly hours in the Garden of the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> where he had the priviledge to walk, being a retired and very pleaſant place, and that wherein he took great delight. But alas, how different were theſe days from thoſe at <hi>Rome!</hi> the <hi>Italians</hi> are natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly apt to be Melancholy, and this Solitude made the Count ſo: The <hi>Baſſa,</hi> who loved him ſincere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and paſſionately, wiſhed to have him always in good humour, was troubled to find him ſad and dejected; but having often enquired the cauſe, could not obtain farther ſatisfaction, than that it was an effect of his Temper: He had furniſhed him to exceſs with all that Countrey could afford for the Pleaſures of Life, and could not imagine the cauſe of the grief, but fancied at laſt, that to compleat his Divertiſements, <hi>Alexander</hi> might
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:60459:183"/>
want the converſation of a Woman. The <hi>Baſſa</hi> being a Perſon much given to Gallantry, was the more eaſily inclined to believe he had found the true cauſe of his Melancholy. And looked upon it as no incurable Diſeaſe, but preſently reſolved to find out a Remedy, by furniſhing him with a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs, which was a high ſtrain of complaiſance in a Perſon of his Character; but there were no li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits to the Love he had for his <hi>Alexander.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Law of <hi>Mahomet</hi> is very ſevere in this Point, againſt Perſons of another Religion, though very indulgent to thoſe of his own. Thoſe who fall into the Hands of the <hi>Turks,</hi> and will make love to their Women, are under the neceſſity of changing their Religion, or Burning: theſe Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities are hard, yet of the many Chriſtians re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to thoſe ſtraits, I know not one who hath thought Martyrdom ſo charming, as not to prefer Circumciſion before Burning: the <hi>Baſſa,</hi> though no zealous obſerver of the Law, was wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling however to avoid the Scandal that might fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, if the Intrigue were diſcovered, and therefore deſign'd to marry him to a Chriſtian. There was with the <hi>Sultaneſs</hi> his Wife, an <hi>Italian Slave,</hi> a young Maid of good quality, lovely and witty: it was not long ſince the <hi>Baſſa</hi> had been in love with her, but without any ſucceſs: whether it proceeded from the reſpect ſhe bore to the <hi>Sultaneſs</hi> her Miſtreſs, who loved her intirely, or from ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Conſcience in point of Religion, with which ſhe excuſed her ſelf, certain it is, his addreſſes were vain; and after three Months eager purſuit of his deſign, being not accuſtom'd to ſo much reſiſtance, he quitted her, and caſt his eyes on other leſs diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult conqueſts: he hoped that one Chriſtian with
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:60459:184"/>
another might have better ſucceſs, and that <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> being very lovely, and young, needed only to ſhew himſelf for gaining the love of a Maid of his Country, profeſſing the ſame Religion with him: he endeavour'd to diſpoſe her for the purpoſe, by raiſing in her an eſteem for the Gallant he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided her: he had often ſpoken of him in the Chamber of the <hi>Sultaneſs,</hi> where <hi>Laura,</hi> the Slave we are diſcourſing of, did conſtantly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend.</p>
                  <p>And having formed the deſign, he ſeldom en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained them with any thing elſe, but <hi>Alexander did this,</hi> or <hi>Alexander ſaid that;</hi> of which he gave them ſo pleaſant Deſcriptions, that he could not fail of making ſome impreſſions of love for him in a Woman, though never ſo little ſuſceptible.</p>
                  <p>The Count knew nothing of all theſe good Offices; the <hi>Baſſa</hi> ſmiling ſometimes at his ſadneſs, would tell him, he ſhould ſhortly ſee him in a different humor. One having diſpoſed all things on <hi>Laura</hi>'s ſide, (who had told him, ſhe would not be diſpleas'd to ſee this Chriſtian) he took him into the Garden of the <hi>Seraglio</hi> to walk, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a turn or two, asked him if he had ever been in love. The queſtion did very much ſurprize him, apprehending, that being among a People natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuſpicious, the <hi>Baſſa</hi> might perhaps have had ſome Jealouſie of him, though he could not ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine the cauſe. But to diſabuſe him, he held it neceſſary to affect great indifference in the buſineſs of Women, and (the truth is) to that day he had not been in love. And though it were ill court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip to the <hi>Baſſa,</hi> who was an admirer of Women, to tell him he had never been in Love; yet he choſe rather to commit a ſolaeciſm in courtſhip,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:60459:184"/>
than to give him the leaſt cauſe of ſuſpicion The <hi>Baſſa</hi> adviſed him to have a care of himſelf, leſt Love ſhould one day be revenged of him, and told him, he deſpaired not of ſeeing him a Lover in <hi>Barbary: You are,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>handſom and witty, and there are here, as in</hi> Europe, <hi>dangerous Ladies, who perhaps may have deſigns on your liberty; and you are not yet got out of</hi> Tunis: This Diſcourſe unexpected, and ſpoken with ſuch an Air, ſo troub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the <hi>Count,</hi> he knew not what anſwer to make. The <hi>Baſſa</hi> much pleaſed at the diſorder he had put him to; <hi>What,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>doth Love appear ſo ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible to you, that you dare not encounter it? can a Man of your bravery be afraid of a Paſſion? Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collect your ſelf, and think it not ſo dreadful here as in</hi> Italy; <hi>you arm your</hi> Cupid <hi>with weapons of War, we dreſs ours with Flowers; nothing is leſs cruel than Love among the</hi> Turks: <hi>our Women are kind, and good natured, and never are the cauſe of any mans death by coyneſs and diſdain; the ſole difficulty is in getting a ſight of them; gain but that point, and nothing can be more eaſie than the reſt: your Ladies are ſcrupulous and ſhy of ſhewing favour to theirs Lovers, and ours make a conſcience of ſeeing theirs Languiſh: it is not ſo odious to be fond and coming with you, as 'tis to be cruel and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible here. We follow in the firſt place the Law of nature, preferring it to</hi> Mohomets, <hi>as being Men before we are</hi> Muſlulmans. <hi>We hold our ſelves ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to pay kind regard and affectionate tenderneſs to Female Beauty, and expect from it a return of complacency. And thoſe who approve not theſe</hi> Maxims, <hi>we eſteem unworthy to taſte the pleaſures of Love. I know that in</hi> Europe <hi>you uſe this Paſſion an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary way, making that Martyrdom which
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:60459:185"/>
ſhould be a delight; but I would fain know, what the deſign of that Woman can be, who ſees a man every day on his knees at her feet, ſighing for that which ſhe alſo deſires, and it may be, more paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onately. Why then muſt he be tormented? Why ſo many ſighs, why ſo many tears expected from him, when the paſſion of both Sexes is equal, if that of the Female may not paſs for the greater?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Count having in this time recollected him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, anſwered; <hi>I believe, Sir, that in Love as in other matters every one may have his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular fancy, and different</hi> Maxims <hi>for conduct: but if I, who was never in Love, may be allow'd to deliver my opinion of it, I conceive that Men born under a Law, are inſenſibly diſpoſed to bear it with eaſe. And I dare confidently affirm, there is more ſweetneſs, and charming delight in the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments we endure in our way of Loving, than in thoſe eaſie pleaſures that coſt you nothing: think not, Sir, thoſe torments ſo cruel as our Lovers repreſent them; they aggravate them only to affect their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſes the more, and to make them more ſenſible. It would certainty ſurprize you to hear them cry,</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe, O love, Increaſe ſo ſweet a pain: <hi>their ſufferings are pleaſures.</hi> The <hi>Baſſa</hi> was ſo charmed with hearing him ſpeak, that he would not inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt him, ſo that he proceeded, <hi>What ſatisfaction can you find in a Love that is fulſom and dull, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any pique to make it poynant, and ſeaſon it for reliſh? What divertiſement to be expected from an innocent</hi> Cupid, <hi>a Child without wit, without wag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery, that permits you to do in all things as you pleaſe?</hi> The <hi>Baſſa</hi> could not forbear laughing, and told him, that to make him believe that Love the moſt charming, that made him ſuffer moſt, he muſt make it appear by trial in himſelf by being in
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:60459:185"/>
Love, enduring with pleaſure all the torments he ſpoke of: <hi>Sir,</hi> ſaid <hi>Alexander, I was never in love in my Country, where you know we have freedom of living, and Liberty of converſe with the Female Sex; it is not probable then I ſhall fall in love here, where we are not allow'd ſo much as a ſight of them: means may be found,</hi> replied the <hi>Baſſa, to ſatisfie you in that particular, if you deſire it. I do not conceive it for my advantage,</hi> ſaid the Count, <hi>to thruſt my ſelf into the fire to try the experiment, or to change my Religion. No, no,</hi> ſaid the <hi>Baſſa, it is with a Chriſtian I would have you acquainted, and one in my judgment very beautiful, and not unworthy your ſighs: had I been of your mind, and like the Lovers of your Country, taken pleaſure in being vext and tormented, my buſineſs might have been done. She made me pine for her above three Months, till weary of a Miſtreſs that had ſo little ſenſe of my pain, I betook my ſelf to others that were more of my humour; her beauty and wit will certainly charm you, and you may find her as haughty, as fierce, as cruel as you can wiſh: it may be difficult to have a ſight of her, as being with the</hi> Sultaneſs, <hi>who, ſince ſhe knew the incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations I had for her, would never permit her to ſtep out of her Apartment: but I'le bring you thither diſguiſed as an Eunuch; there is no other way of entrance for you into the Seraglio: and you are ſo young, that by Night you may paſs for an Eunuch without any ſuſpicion.</hi> The Count gave him a thouſand thanks for the favour, not but that he could have been very well content to have been without it, having no great deſire to engage him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in Acquaintance in a Country where he would tarry as ſhort time as he could; yet in complaiſance
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:60459:186"/>
to the <hi>Baſſa,</hi> and of Curioſity to ſee a Slave the <hi>Baſſa</hi> repreſented ſo beautiful, he accepted this offer with ſome kind of joy.</p>
                  <p>The fourth Prayer being over, he came to his Patron, being the time he uſually went to the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raglio:</hi> And having taken the Habit of an <hi>Eunuch</hi> provided for him there, he waited on the <hi>Baſſa</hi> to the Apartment of the <hi>Sultaneſs: Laura,</hi> who had notice of their coming, waited their entrance; the <hi>Baſſa</hi> came ſmiling up to her, and whiſpered her in the Ear, that he had brought her an Eunuch, who could tell her News out of <hi>Italy;</hi> pray'd her to have a care of him, and to uſe him as a Perſon he lov'd entirely. <hi>Laura</hi> fell a laughing, and anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, ſhe doubted not but the Eunuch ſhould give him a good account of his Reception. The Count, though Diſguiſed, was ſo eaſie to be known, that, had the <hi>Baſſa</hi> ſaid nothing, his good <hi>Mien</hi> had diſcovered him: No Eunuch, no <hi>Turk</hi> had ſo good an air. She gave him her hand to lead her into a Chamber, where they ſhould not be expoſed to their view who paſt by. <hi>Sir,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>I know not what thanks to give the</hi> Baſſa <hi>for the favour he hath done me, to afford me a ſight of you, no man being allowed entrance here but himſelf, and the Eunuch whoſe Habit he hath cauſed you to take. I cannot impute it to any thing but the extraordinary affection he hath and daily declares for you. 'Tis true, Madam,</hi> anſwered the Count, <hi>the kindneſs of the</hi> Baſſa <hi>to me is extream; but if either of us have reaſon to be concerned how to thank him, (as he very well deſerves) 'tis certainly I, for the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour he hath procured me; yet I could wiſh I were not wholly beholding to him for it, but that (as he would have me believe) you had a hand in it. Sir,</hi>
                     <pb n="17" facs="tcp:60459:186"/>
replyed <hi>Laura, I ſhall tell you no lye, I have made it ſufficiently known to you, I deſired this favour from him. He told us things ſo glorious of you, and rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them ſo much to your advantage, you may eaſily believe, I (who, for three years I have been here, have not had the Liberty of Converſe with any Man) could not but deſire acquaintance of a Perſon ſo generally eſteemed. Madam,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try hath been favourable in allowing me a Reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which perhaps I may find difficult to maintain in your Opinion. You need not fear that,</hi> reply'd <hi>Laura, your Mien confirms ſufficiently the reports that have paſt of you. But to change the Diſcourſe, do you know,</hi> ſaid ſhe ſmiling, <hi>that ſometimes 'tis dangerous in a Nation like this, to make your ſelf ſo much the ſubject of Diſcourſe; if not on the Mens account, yet certainly on the Womens, who fall in Love meerly on report, without a ſight or know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Party:</hi> The Count anſwer'd ſmiling, <hi>Madam, there is no danger of your being of the number of thoſe kind-hearted Ladies, I am not ſo Fortunate. And why,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>might not I be one, who have ſo long'd for a ſight of you: but to loſe no more time, I muſt tell you, your Fortune is better than you think; and I do that for another, which perhaps I would not have done for my ſelf. The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of ſeeing a Man is here reputed a mighty ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of Love, where to ſee and to agree are all one. But I have undertaken this affair, and made the</hi> Baſſa <hi>believe I have very favourable thoughts of you. And to ſatisfie your Curioſity of knowing the Party for whom I have ſo much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaiſance in ſtore, it is for the</hi> Baſſa<hi>'s Lady, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> Alhie <hi>the</hi> Sultaneſs: <hi>The confidence ſhe is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to repoſe in me is ſo great, that ſhe hath entruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:60459:187"/>
me with this Secret, and my kindneſs for her ſhould not admit one moments ſcruple doing her this Service. I cannot doubt but you have heard of her Beauty; never was any ſo famous in this Kingdom, nor perhaps in the World, more worthy admiration: And as for her temper, 'tis the ſweeteſt and moſt lovely that can be imagined. The firſt view you have of her, will perſwade you ſhe hath an Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to Love, ſo tender, ſo languiſhing is the air of her Countenance. And though this be natural to the Women of this Country, and that the firſt thing they are taught, is to ſigh, and appear languiſhing, yet I have not obſerved thoſe weakneſſes in her but on your account. To deduce things from the Original, I muſt inform you, that when the</hi> Baſſa <hi>returned from</hi> Conſtantinople, <hi>having diſpatched the Affair depending there between him, and the King, and</hi> Divan <hi>of this place, and being confirmed by the</hi> Grand Signior <hi>in the Offices his Father had left him, which they had diſputed; the King, in order to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation, was adviſed to give the</hi> Baſſa <hi>his Daughter in Marriage.</hi> Alhie <hi>was then Sixteen Years old, and her beauty at the height; though at this day in my judgment, no man that ſees her, but muſt be in Love with her. Theſe Marriages of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy and State intereſt, to which the Daughters of great ones are ſubject to be Sacrificed, ſeldom prove Happy. The</hi> Baſſa <hi>Eſpouſed</hi> Alhie, <hi>and perhaps lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved her a Week, but after that returned to his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Engagements, and for ordinary Beauties quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the greateſt of the Kingdom. 'Tis true, it often happens thus in this Country, where Men abhor lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving by Duty and Obligation, and commonly love Miſtreſſes better than Wives: But this Lady, in my Opinion, ought to have been excepted, as wanting
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:60459:187"/>
nothing requiſite to ſatisfie the Paſſion of any reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Man; but ſhe is as unfortunate as others. The</hi> Baſſa, <hi>though otherwiſe a Perſon of much Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantry, viſits her ſcarce once in a Month; yet he pays her all the reſpect in the World, and ſhe hath no cauſe of complaint but of his Love; but take Love from Marriage, what ſignifies the reſt? What a trouble is it to a Young Lady, who knows her own merit, to ſee her ſelf ſlighted in that whereof ſhe is moſt ſenſible? A Lady who would think her ſelf happy in being belov'd, and thinks ſhe deſerves it: You muſt be a Woman before you can comprehend the rigor of this uſage, and the greatneſs of her misfortune. But to come to what concerns you; the</hi> Sultaneſs <hi>hath ever had a great inclination for Chriſtians; and the greateſt Pleaſure ſhe takes, is, in ſtories ſhe makes me tell of my Country, which ſurpriſe her ſo (eſpecially when I ſpeak of the Freedom Men have there with Women) that ſhe hath a thouſand times wiſhed her Fortune had been as mine, and that ſhe had fallen into the hands of a Chriſtian, who would have carried her into that Country 'Tis certain, a Woman had better be a Slave with us, than free among the</hi> Turks, <hi>where their Life is nothing but a perpetual Slavery. The Adventures of Love and Gallantry have pleaſed her ſo well in the relation, that ſhe longs for a ſight of one of thoſe I called Perſons of Quality and Merit, who were ſo Gallant and Handſom, as I repreſented. You were no ſooner arrived, but ſhe came with great joy to tell me, the</hi> Baſſa <hi>had newly bought a Chriſtian of whom they ſpoke Wonders. I fell a laughing, and asked if it were not ſuch a one ſhe had often wiſh'd for her Slave. She bluſhed, and turning about with a ſigh, anſwer'd, who knows what may happen,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:60459:188"/>
and whether Fortune hath not deſigned him for me. She made me her Bedfellow that Night, to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain her on that ſubject. On the morrow the</hi> Baſſa <hi>having confirmed the reports of you, and commended your Perſon, ſhe and I for ſeveral days had no diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe but of you. The kindneſs ſhe hath for me, makes me ſomewhat familiar with her; nor do we very ſtrictly obſerve here our diſtance towards great ones; this made me ſometimes take the Liberty to quarrel with her for the longing ſhe expreſt for a Man ſhe had not ſeen. I confeſs,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>this were falling in Love a little too ſoon, if we managed our Love as the Chriſtians do theirs. But the</hi> Baſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa <hi>having made ſuch a deſcription of this Man, there is not a Woman in the Kingdom who would not have had a greater Paſſion for him than I have expreſt. And you may believe he would not have ſpoken ſo much in his praiſe before the meaneſt of his Empreſſes; but though he ſlight me ſo, that he cares not what I think, my Affections are free. You would eſteem your ſelf happy, Madam,</hi> ſaid I, <hi>to have ſuch a Chriſtian in Love with you. More happy,</hi> reply'd ſhe, <hi>than you can imagine. And I will aſſure you, I could willingly change the ſtate I am in, for the condition of a private Chriſtian Lady: What good does it me, to abound thus with Riches, to receive ſo much Honour, to be the Daughter of a King, and the Wife of a</hi> Baſſa, <hi>if I cannot be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, nor do as I would, nor love where love is due? In a word, I am nothing leſs than I am taken to be, but a Slave more unhappy than thoſe under Chains. Poor</hi> Laura (ſaid ſhe, embracing me tenderly) <hi>how I pity thee, who haſt taſted the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures and Liberty of thy Country, and haſt unhappily
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:60459:188"/>
fallen into their hands who uſe ſo unworthily all ſorts of Women.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>With ſuch diſcourſes as theſe did we entertain our ſelves ever ſince they ſpoke of you at</hi> Tunis. <hi>The</hi> Baſſa <hi>came oftner to viſit the</hi> Sultaneſs, <hi>though we knew not the reaſon; and almoſt every day brought us the News of you: And, as he loves you entirely, took pleaſure in relating every thing you did. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, had he known the favourable inclinations the</hi> Sultaneſs <hi>had for you, he had been more ſparing in his expreſſions of you, for I cannot believe he deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to prejudice himſelf in ſpeaking obligingly of you. But it was an overſight, and moſt unpardonable in him who ſo well knew the temper of Women of this Country: Judge you whether ſo good a report from ſo good a hand could want its effect. The</hi> Sultaneſs <hi>was affected with them ſo much to the purpoſe, that what at firſt was a bare inclination, grew up by degrees to a ſettled Paſſion. Her humour was ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly chang'd from Merry and Jocund, into Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Melancholy; and I, who alone knew her Diſtemper, could not but pity her ſighs and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, and was extreamly afraid ſhe might fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Diſeaſe, which they call Fantaſie, and is a kind of Melancholy that proves Mortal to many Men and Women of this Country. I did my endeavour to cure her of this Paſſion, by repreſenting to her all the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacles in her way to the happineſs ſhe deſired. But my Remedies came too late, I did but trouble her to no purpoſe, having ſaid to her ſelf all that I could poſſibly ſay to divert her from the affection ſhe had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken: So that deſpairing of Remedy on that ſide, I apply'd my thoughts another way, and flatter'd her hopes of bringing that to paſs, which I could not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the leaſt poſſibility to effect. But to prevent
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:60459:189"/>
the growth and increaſe of her Diſtemper, it was neceſſary to deceive her by flatteries and hopes. At laſt, I know not how it fell out, that the</hi> Baſſa <hi>ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſpoken of you to me two days ago, as he fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently does when he finds me alone, I told him, I ſhould be very glad to ſee you, if it might be done without noiſe and ſcandal: I was extreamly aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd how eaſily he promiſed it: And you may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve I had not waited here for you, but that I very well knew him a Man of his word.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Count having hearken'd to all this diſcourſe with marvellous attention, and thanked <hi>Laura</hi> for all her good Offices, and anſwer'd all her obliging expreſſions in behalf of the <hi>Sultaneſs,</hi> diſcovered to her the <hi>Baſſa</hi>'s deſign, and the reaſon of his being brought thither; <hi>Laura</hi> was raviſhed to hear his diſcourſe, and though ſhe foreſaw her concern in the Affair was like to be ſmall, yet ſhe was pleas'd with the News ſhe received, being willing to ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice all Intereſts of her own, to the ſatisfaction of her Lady. <hi>But, Sir, to tell you all,</hi> ſaid ſhe to the Count, <hi>having paid my thanks to the</hi> Baſſa <hi>for the favour I was in hopes of from him, I went preſently to bring the News to the</hi> Sultaneſs, <hi>who could not ſufficiently embrace me, being ſo extreamly tranſpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that nothing in the World could have made her more joyful; ſhe hath ſcarcely been able to ſleep ever ſince: She and I have laid a hundred deſigns, and framed to our ſelves a thouſand devices how ſhe may have a ſight of you: but if the</hi> Baſſa <hi>will not permit you to come alone hither, I do not ſee how it may be effected: The</hi> Sultaneſs <hi>in the mean time will be ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhed with joy that I have ſeen you, and that you know ſome part of her mind.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="23" facs="tcp:60459:189"/>The happy <hi>Roman</hi> being charmed at the kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs a Lady of that beauty and quality had for him, was very urgent with <hi>Laura</hi> to oblige him on this occaſion, and preſs'd her to ſay to the <hi>Sultaneſs</hi> from him, all that a heart extreamly ſenſible of the favour ſhe did him, was capable to expreſs. That he would have eſteem'd himſelf the happieſt of men, had it been in his power to have merited this honor, and that it ſhould be the buſineſs of his Life, to deſerve it by his Actions. <hi>Sir,</hi> reply'd <hi>Laura, all ſhe deſires of you, is that you will ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage the Liberty the</hi> Baſſa <hi>doth afford you, that ſhe may once have a ſight of you: I find my ſelf en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged to it by ſo many reaſons,</hi> ſaid the Count, <hi>that you may be aſſured I will not forget any thing that may gain this honour: I muſt intreat you to aſſure the</hi> Sultaneſs <hi>accordingly, and that I have at leaſt as much paſſion as ſhe.</hi> He had no ſooner ſaid this, but the <hi>Baſſa</hi> came to them, which made them change their diſcourſe, and the <hi>Baſſa</hi> having con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcended to make himſelf one of the company, and very pleaſantly rallied; then ſaid, he perceived by their Countenances they were obliged to him for the Acquaintance he had procured between them, and that they were very well pleaſed the one with the other: The Count and <hi>Laura</hi> having retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the Complement, the <hi>Baſſa</hi> took his leave, and he and the Count went out of the <hi>Seraglio.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Baſſa</hi> had obſerved ſuch joy in <hi>Alexander's</hi> Countenance when he was with <hi>Laura,</hi> it made him believe he was very well pleaſed with the viſit he had given her. But he had the curioſity to ask him how he liked her; and whether ſhe appeared ſo beautiful as he had repreſented her: The Count anſwer'd, it was certainly impoſſible to ſee a Lady
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:60459:190"/>
more handſom, or more witty: And that he was charmed at her Beauty and Converſation. The <hi>Baſſa,</hi> who deſired nothing more than to ſee him in Love was extreamly glad at the confeſſion he made; and told him it ſhould be his fault, if he ſaw her not again, and, if he deſired, he might do it on the morrow, that he would give him a Key to enter the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> and that he might go alone; leſt if he brought him in, the <hi>Sultaneſs</hi> might be jealous: it being not his cuſtom to viſit her ſo often, the Count failed not to acquaint him how highly that favour would oblige him; ſo that the <hi>Baſſa</hi> bid him go to bed, and take his reſt, and told him he ſhould ſee <hi>Laura</hi> on the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row about the time he had ſeen her that day.</p>
                  <p>Never was a night ſo reſtleſs to any man, as this to the Count, her inclination, like that he had to marriage, with the principal and moſt beautiful Lady of the Kingdom, was a thing ſo rare, and ſo tempting for a man of his temper; what <hi>Laura</hi> had ſaid of thoſe obliging thoughts that charming Perſon had for him, did ſo raviſh him with Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, that in the depth of misfortune he could not imagine any man more fortunate than himſelf: But when he conſidered, that ſhe was the Wife of the <hi>Baſſa,</hi> a Perſon to whom he was ſo ſtrictly obliged, he was troubled extreamly, and ſigh'd for ſorrow; theſe ſecond thoughts prevailing at that time over the other, he highly reproached himſelf for enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining a thought of ſo baſe an ingratitude. But it is a tickliſh buſineſs to repent of a thing that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly delights us, and men ſeldom charge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves home for a fault ſo pleaſing and lovely, as the pleaſure of being beloved: Thoſe reproaches of the <hi>Count</hi> againſt himſelf, were not altogether the
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:60459:190"/>
moſt violent that might be, and ſometimes he would be angry with himſelf for making ſo much ado. At laſt, being aſſaulted by turns, on the one ſide by Reaſon, on the other by Paſſion, by the Glory of that, and the tenderneſs of this, he got up in the Morning, without having been able to take any other reſolution than to yield himſelf up to be guided by his Deſtiny, to be governed by Fate, and be meerly paſſive in the management of the buſineſs; that is to ſay, to love, in this particular, like a <hi>Turk,</hi> and to ſee the <hi>Sultaneſs,</hi> if it were ſo predeſtinated: But to do nothing in order to it, though he had promiſed <hi>Laura</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute on his part all that lay in his power, and had told the <hi>Baſſa,</hi> he ſhould be extreamly glad to go again to the <hi>Seraglio.</hi> His reſolution ſometimes was very tottering and weak, and to ſpeak truth, 'tis almoſt vain to take one againſt love: He wiſht a thouſand times that day, that his Fate to whoſe conduct he had given himſelf up, would incline to bring him to the <hi>Sultaneſs.</hi> He waited the Hour with a great deal of impatience, however he would fain have perſwaded himſelf to the contrary: But a young heart cannot be inſenſible, being ſo apt to take fire, that it ſcarce requires any help to inflame it.</p>
                  <p>As ſoon as the <hi>Baſſa</hi> ſaw the Count in the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening, he ſhew'd him (ſmiling) the Key of the <hi>Seraglio:</hi> And he received it with the greateſt joy in the World. <hi>But I give it,</hi> ſaid the Baſſa, <hi>on condition that you make me your Confident. And I think I have done enough to engage you to do me that pleaſure.</hi> The hour was come for his going to the <hi>Sultaneſs,</hi> and the Count having put on his Eunuchs Habit, his Patron every day more obliging
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:60459:191"/>
than other, would needs bear him company as far as the <hi>Seraglio; Laura</hi> having notice of his coming, had waited for him above an hour at the Gate, and no ſooner ſaw him arrived, but raviſhed with joy, ſhe gave him her hand, and told him, <hi>You are either the moſt dexterous, or elſe the moſt fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Perſon in the World: you bring about things ſo difficult and in ſo ſhort a time, that all things ſeem to joyn in your favour: I am obliged for it to my fortune,</hi> anſwered the <hi>Count; for, as for Addreſſes I had no occaſion to uſe any, but if you would make me believe my ſelf as happy as you ſay, help me to a ſight of the</hi> Sultaneſs. <hi>Laura</hi> told him, he ſhould preſently hear of her, and brought him into a Chamber, where her Lady was uſed to receive viſits. It was her cuſtom to ſeat her ſelf in a kind of <hi>Alcove,</hi> the paſſage to which was through her Chamber, made up with great <hi>Balliſtres</hi> guilt, and covered with a Curtain of very thin Silk, through which ſhe could ſee thoſe whom ſhe honoured on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with a ſight of her; which is a piece of State uſed in that Country.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Laura</hi> told the Count, that the <hi>Sultaneſs</hi> would ſee him from behind that Curtain. <hi>And ſhall not I then,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>have the honour to ſee her. I know not,</hi> ſaid <hi>Laura, but 'tis a favour ſo great, that 'tis never granted but when they are willing to grant all that may be expected: Ah Madam,</hi> ſaid the <hi>Count, I beſeech you to deſire that favour for me; tell her it will be of ſmall conſequence to give a ſtranger a ſight of her, and that I ſhall die with grief if ſhe deny me that honour. Laura</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed him all the aſſiſtance in her power, and leaving him for a moment, went to advertiſe the <hi>Sultaneſs,</hi> who queſtionleſs longed for news of the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:60459:191"/>
arrival of her dearly beloved Chriſtian. In the mean time the Count conſidered the Riches and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments of the Chamber, being the moſt magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent of the Apartment, it was ſet out with four Cryſtal Glaſſes which had a pleaſant effect on the Gold and the Jewels which glitter'd all about: Scarce had the <hi>Sultaneſs</hi> ſeen <hi>Laura,</hi> but ſhe knew by her countenance the happy news ſhe brought; and without allowing her time to ſay any thing, ſhe paſt to the <hi>Alcove,</hi> from whence ſhe deſign'd to take a view of the Chriſtian, before he ſhould know that ſhe was there. But ſhe made too great a noiſe at her entrance, and the <hi>Cavalier</hi> let her know, he had perceivd her, by ſaluting her as he did, after the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> mode: <hi>Laura</hi> arrived the ſame time from the other ſide, and going to the <hi>Balliſtre,</hi> went to whiſper the <hi>Sultaneſs,</hi> who was not able ſufficiently to expreſs the pleaſure ſhe took in ſeeing this Chriſtian, and the Charms that appear'd in his Perſon. As for him, he was ſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perplext at a viſit of this nature, where he could neither ſee, nor ſpeak to the Party he viſited. He went, he came, he turn'd about as deſired, and at the end of the Shew, went ſilently to the <hi>Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſtre,</hi> and addreſſing himſelf to the <hi>Sultaneſs,</hi> having ſeen a ſhadow of her through the Curtain, he told her a thouſand pretty Stories, a thouſand Gallantries to oblige her to afford him a view, for ſhe underſtood <hi>Italian,</hi> and ſpoke it pretty well, having learnt it of <hi>Laura.</hi> She was very well pleas d to hear the <hi>Count</hi> ſpeak, and heartily laught at it, but anſwered not a word, nor had the Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain drawn. The <hi>Count</hi> was impatient, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counting every moment loſt he ſpent in that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, ſeem'd to fret and be angry, and in a frank
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:60459:192"/>
and free way told her, he ſhould die of the Phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſie, as the People of that Country, if ſhe denied him this favour, and that at laſt he would with his own hand draw that troubleſome Curtain: and he had certainly done it, if <hi>Laura,</hi> who fear'd the <hi>Sultaneſs</hi> might take it ill, had not hindred him. But <hi>Laura</hi> was miſtaken, and her Lady gave her not thanks for her pains.</p>
                  <p>'Tis a Maxim among the Women of that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, not to ſin of themſelves againſt the Rules of their duty; but preſs them a little, and offer them the leaſt violence, they will preſently yield without any reſiſtance: their excuſe is, that nature is weak, that men know it well enough, and are very much to blame to preſs them ſo home: that if there be harm done, it muſt be laid to their ſcore, who cauſe them to do it, and not to them who are ignorant of it, and innocent in the buſineſs. <hi>Laura</hi> not well verſt in the uſe of this Maxim, committed a fault, when ſhe thought ſhe had been diſcharging her duty. The amorous <hi>Sultaneſs</hi> would have been raviſh'd with joy to have been ſeen by the Chriſtian, and the officious Slave ſpoil'd all by a piece of uſeleſs diſcretion. But her Lady was willing to receive the miſcarri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, and ſatisfie in ſome meaſure the extream deſire her dear Chriſtian had to ſee her; ſhe gave him leave to ask what he pleaſed, to make him amends for the rigour of the cuſtom of that Country, which made it undecent for her Sex to ſhew themſelves to any but their Husband. The <hi>Count</hi> preſently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired ſhe would at leaſt do him the honour of ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him one of her fair hands: The <hi>Sultaneſs</hi> no ſooner heard him, but lifting up the Curtain a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, ſhe gave him her hand over the <hi>Balliſtre.</hi> The young <hi>Count</hi> was ſo charmed with this favour,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:60459:192"/>
that tranſported with joy, he laid his knee to the ground, and kiſſed her hand with ſuch paſſion; that the <hi>Sultaneſs,</hi> equally tranſported, wrung his hand, preſſing it ſo hard, to let him know ſhe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved of what he did. She was not over careful to keep her ſelf unſeen; and having put forth her arm, ſhe could not chooſe, but ſometimes appear to him in part by one chance or other (to which perhaps ſhe contributed a little.) Her Gallant could have wiſh'd he had had a full ſight of her, but thinking he had enough for the firſt time, he would not adventure to deſire any more. The pleaſure the <hi>Sultaneſs</hi> took in the ſight of him, was ſo great, and ſo charming, that ſhe could have willingly paſt that night with him. But know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that many eyes were upon her, and that ſhe lived where men are extreamly given to jealouſie, and eſpecially of their Wives, ſhe had apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of being Lampoon'd in her own Apartment for ſtaying ſo long in the <hi>Alcove,</hi> at a time ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſonable for receiving a viſit. And <hi>Laura</hi> had told her, 'twas time to withdraw. But how cruel a thing 'tis to be forced to part from that which we love? it cannot be done without pain and regret. Still ſhe found ſome little pretence or other to ſtay him a little longer; at laſt ſhe preſented him with a Gold Chain beſet with Jewels, and told him obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gingly it was not fit a Slave like him ſhould wear any other. The happy <hi>Count</hi> better ſatisfy'd with this Chain, than if ſhe had given him the Grown of <hi>Tunis,</hi> anſwered her Gallantry, and the favour ſhe did him, with the moſt paſſionate and the moſt grateful expreſſions imaginable. And ſeeing the neceſſity of parting, he took his leave of the <hi>Sulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi>
                     <pb n="30" facs="tcp:60459:193"/>
and withdrew with <hi>Laura,</hi> who accompanied him to the Gate of the Apartment.</p>
                  <p>Preſents among the <hi>Turks,</hi> are the firſt Eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of affections, and often paſs for declarations of love. <hi>Laura,</hi> who knew it well enough, made the <hi>Count</hi> ſenſible, before parting, what that meant which he had received from the <hi>Sultaneſs;</hi> and that he was not to doubt, having heard and ſeen ſo much of her, but ſhe paſſionately lov'd him. Yet he was to take heed, and believe he had need of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of diſcretion, to deal with the Women of that Country, whoſe paſſion of love is ſometimes ſo violent, that they obſerve no bounds; that the <hi>Sultaneſs</hi> was indeed the moſt rational ſhe had known amongſt them, and had the moſt wit, yet tender and paſſionate as the reſt. That ſhe and he would be immutably ruined, if the <hi>Baſſa,</hi> who had no ſmall experience in Amours, ſhould once have the leaſt ſuſpicion of the Intrigue. That there was not in the Kingdom a man more tender of his honour than he; and that all the kindneſs he had for him, would not ſave him from his indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, if he once came to know he had ſeen his Wife.</p>
                  <p>As much taken as our young <hi>Roman</hi> was with the pleaſant beginnings of his Amours, and for all his rejoycings at thoſe evident kindneſſes he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from the greateſt Beauty under Heaven, yet he could not forbear reflecting on <hi>Laura</hi>'s good counſels, but went muſing along the <hi>Seragilo,</hi> what courſe he ſhould take, what means he ſhould uſe againſt ſo dangerous a Paſſion, which would cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly bring him to ruin and confuſion. When the <hi>Baſſa,</hi> going to one of his Miſtreſſes, met him by the way, and ſeeing him paſs by, without ſo much
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:60459:193"/>
as ſaluting him, he preſently fell a laughing, and taking him by the arm, <hi>Now,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>I ſee that you are in love.</hi> The Count being confounded at his ſurprizing him in that caſe, made excuſes for his fault. The <hi>Baſſa</hi> made anſwer, that if he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſir'd to be pardon'd, he muſt freely confeſs the truth, and acknowledge himſelf extreamly diſordered at the Merits and Beauty of <hi>Laura: More Sir</hi> (ſaid the Count, with a very deep ſigh) <hi>than you can poſſibly expreſs or imagine.</hi> But it being late, and the <hi>Baſſa</hi> not willing to ſtay, he deferred the more particular inquiry to another opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and diſmiſs'd him to his Lodging. This was a great happineſs, and no leſs pleaſure to the young Lover, who was not then in a condition to give the <hi>Baſſa</hi> an account of his Amours. Part of that night he paſs'd walking in his Chamber, as if he had intended to come to a Reſolution before he went to bed. It was not the fear of death, or misfortune that troubled him, but the horrour of ingratitude; and having received ſo much kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs from the <hi>Baſſa,</hi> thought it inexcuſable in him to have any unjuſt deſigns on his Wife: <hi>But,</hi> then ſays he, <hi>ſhould I not be the moſt ungrateful of men, ſhould I ſlight the affection of ſo charming a Perſon, to whom, if I conſider her obligations according to their value, I owe more than to the</hi> Baſſa? <hi>And is it not poſſible for me to ſee, and to love her with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in bounds, ſo as to be blameleſs on the one ſide and the other? No, no, if there be ingratitude in that, I cannot help it, there is nothing in the World can excuſe me to the</hi> Sultaneſs, <hi>and love ought to make my excuſe with the</hi> Baſſa.</p>
                  <p>This was the laſt Combate between gratitude and love in the heart of the Count; the laſt car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:60459:194"/>
the day, and going to bed thereupon, he reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed very well. The <hi>Baſſa</hi> who was extreamly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous to ſee him ſo deeply in love, that he ſhould not be able to deny it, was the firſt that ſpoke to him, to return again that day to the <hi>Sultaneſs</hi> Lodgings: he gave him the Key of the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> and laughing, told him, he need not make ſuch haſte to come back, if he found as much pleaſure as he wiſht him there: but that he muſt have a care, he did not engroſs all the love to himſelf, but he ſhould give <hi>Laura</hi> ſome part, unleſs he were minded to languiſh as he had done, a long time to no purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>The amorous <hi>Italian</hi> went ſtraight to the <hi>Sera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glio,</hi> and <hi>Laura,</hi> who waited for him, told him at his arrival, he might paſs to the ſame Chamber he had been in, and that ſhe would give her Lady no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of his coming; but ſhe not having the pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of waiting ſo long, was got already into the <hi>Alcove.</hi> The Count having an extream curioſity, and longing for a ſight of that place, thought it convenient for the purpoſe, to make uſe of that time, when he believed the <hi>Sultaneſs</hi> was abſent; and coming up to the <hi>Balliſtre,</hi> gently took up the Curtain. But how was he ſurprized to ſee on the ſudden, that charming Perſon in a Poſture the moſt capable of any, to make one in love.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall not trouble you with a deſcription of the <hi>Alcove,</hi> which being a Room of State for the Wife of ſo puiſſant a Lord, you may eaſily believe, was very noble and rich: It was raiſed a foot higher than the Chamber; the approach to it being by a ſpace cover'd with a fair Turky Carpet, check<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer'd with little ſquares of Damask wrought with Gold. The <hi>Sultaneſs</hi> lay on a Bed of Damask of
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:60459:194"/>
like work; and having deſign'd to ſhew her ſelf that day to the Count, ſhe had not forgot to put her ſelf in an equipage and poſture capable to charm him at firſt ſight: ſhe had turned her face towards the <hi>Balliſtre,</hi> leaning her head careleſly on her left arm, which you might clearly ſee in her great Tiffany ſleeve after the Turkiſh mode. Her black hair was partly pleated with great ropes of Pearl, parting down on her Breaſt, and part on her ſhoulders, and ſet off the clearneſs of her deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate Complexion (vying with the Snow in white<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs) to ſo much advantage, that it wrought won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful effects in the beholder. She had about her body, a ſmall Gold Bodice only, her boſom being half open, and the reſt cover'd with a piece of fine Tiffany, like an Amazons Scarf: all was viſible from her Neck to her Breaſt, and ſo admirable to behold, that it had been impoſſible for an eye, having ſeen it, (as the Count did) to eſcape being enamour'd of it: ſhe had on her head, plumes of ſeveral colours, and in the midſt of them a creſcent of Silver. Her Coat was of a light Stuff Imbroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered with Gold, after the faſhion of the Country, with Diamond Buckles to tuck it up at the knee: her Leg was half naked, and the reſt covered with Buskins all laid over with Diamonds and Pearls; in a word, ſhe was all ſo Rich, ſo Gallant, ſo full of Charms, that the poor <hi>Count</hi> was utterly undone at the ſight. His joy and aſtoniſhment were viſible to her in that confuſion of action and words, in which he was ſo miſerably plung'd, that he knew not what was become of himſelf, nor what he would ſay to her. But falling into an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſie, and wholly ſwallowed up with admiration, his Eyes and his Sighs were Orators for him. The
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:60459:195"/>
fair <hi>Sultaneſs</hi> as ſoon as ſhe ſaw him, would, with a Handkerchief ſhe had in her hand, have covered her face, and hid from him part of the confuſion ſhe was in. But the happy Lover, recovering courage by degrees, paſſing his arm betwixt the <hi>Balliſtres,</hi> hindered her from it. <hi>Once you might have had reaſon Madam,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>to have kept from my ſight thoſe treaſures of love, as knowing full well that no man can ſee them without dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for love of them, but now 'tis too late to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal them from me. I have ſeen more than any heart is able to bear, without yielding it ſelf; and it would be extream cruelty in you, not to compleat what is ſo happily begun.</hi> As the <hi>Count</hi> was ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to her in this manner, ſhe look'd upon him with eyes ſo tender and piercing, that ſhe ſeemed willing to execute what he deſired. The crafty Count having ſeiz'd one of her hands, (to which, as he look'd upon it, he gave a thouſand amorous kiſſes) by little and little drew it out ſo far on his ſide, with ſo feeble reſiſtance from the <hi>Sultaneſs</hi> that ſhe came at laſt to lean her head on the <hi>Balliſtre</hi> juſt over againſt the head of the <hi>Count.</hi> Then it was, he had full liberty to take a view at his lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of thoſe Beauties that put him to amazement, and raviſhed him with ſuch joy as he had never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore been ſenſible of. As ill luck would have it, the <hi>Balliſtres</hi> were ſo cloſe, that not any two of them ſtood half the head diſtance one from the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. However the two Lovers meeting half way, made a ſhift to ſlip through a great number of Kiſſes, the moſt charming and ſweet that Lovers e're taſted. The <hi>Count</hi> being naturally bold, made one Liberty but a ſtep to another, and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what he was permitted to do, and the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:60459:195"/>
ſhe took in it, he preſs'd his amorous temerity ſo far, that what he did may paſs for half an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment. Till then their entertainment was made up of dumb engagements, a thouſand times more eloquent than the fineſt expreſſions in the World. Their eyes, their ſighs, their actions, their toyes had ſpoken a Language intelligible enough to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade both they loved one another intirely. They had no need of other converſation; yet, <hi>Laura</hi> arriving, they changed it a little, but they ſpoke before her the moſt tender, and moſt paſſionate things you can imagine. The <hi>Sultaneſs</hi> who had that confidence in her as to conceal nothing from her, was not troubled at her coming. But the <hi>Count,</hi> who took not ſo much pleaſure in theſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes, though very obliging, as in thoſe dumb entertainments, made a ſign to <hi>Laura</hi> to take the other turn; at which the <hi>Sultaneſs</hi> ſeeming a little angry, let down the Curtain, and ſo faſtned it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind, that he could not take it up. But this being in Jeſt, and to provoke his paſſion the more, her rigour was ſhort-lived, and Peace preſently made more firm than ever.</p>
                  <p>The firſt favours give a priviledge for others, and a kind of right not only to hope, but demand them: The <hi>Count,</hi> to be reveng'd of his <hi>Miſtreſs</hi> for the piece of ſpite ſhe had done him, thruſt both his Arms between the <hi>Balliſtres,</hi> and embracing her on the ſudden, kiſſed her with that violence, that he forced Blood out of her lips. The <hi>Sulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> was ſo far from complaining of the rudeneſs of his Careſſes, that being charm'd with the pleaſure of them, ſhe carefully ſaved all the Blood on her Handkerchief to preſerve it as a Trophy to ſhew
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:60459:196"/>
                     <hi>Laura,</hi> as a moſt ſenſible mark of the extream Paſſion her dear <hi>Alexander</hi> had for her.</p>
                  <p>Let me acquaint you by the way with a rarity of thoſe parts; that for a Woman to have been beaten by a Man ſhe loves, is eſteemed in that Country a great evidence of affection to the party beaten. I confeſs ſuch favours are ſomewhat rude, but 'tis the temper of the Country, and ſuch is their cuſtom: As for the Blood that came from the lips of the Amorous <hi>Sultaneſs,</hi> we may believe it proceeded from a tranſport of Love. With us, one may be bitten, but not beaten through extremity of this Paſſion; but blows exceed the limits of Gallan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and that Woman muſt be an <hi>African,</hi> that loves to be ſo courted. 'Tis a faſhion will never paſs in <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope,</hi> and though they uſe it ſometimes, yet never to oblige Women; none of whom that I know of were ever pleaſed with a baſtinade. The reſt of this viſit having been ſpent in foolery and toys, though ſometimes of much moment in matters of Love, I will not trouble you with the particulars. <hi>Laura,</hi> who was not far diſtant from the Lovers, appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the leaſt ſign of their pleaſure to have her at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend. The Count and the <hi>Sultaneſs</hi> bid each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther adieu with the greateſt kindneſs imaginable: And <hi>Laura</hi> brought him to the Door of the Apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſo deep in Love, he ſcarce knew where he was. He went directly from thence to the <hi>Baſſa,</hi> who inſtantly obſerved the viſible change of the Count's former Sadneſs and Melancholy into a tender and languiſhing air; at which the <hi>Baſſa</hi> taking occaſion to laugh, ſaid, <hi>Well,</hi> Alexander, <hi>hath Love plaid his part well?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="37" facs="tcp:60459:196"/>
                     <hi>Is it your pain, or your pleaſure hath ſo charm'd you to day? I confeſs, Sir,</hi> ſaid he with a ſigh, <hi>it is the pleaſure I have met with; but plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, I fear, which may cauſe me much pain.</hi> The <hi>Baſſa</hi> believing, that to be the Confident of the Count's Paſſion, might be of ſome uſe, took him by the hand, and led him to the Garden, to take a turn in the Walks. He fell preſently upon the ſubject of his good Fortune, and prayed him to tell him truly, how his Affairs ſtood. The Count having his Heart and his Fancy all full of Love, with very great eaſe gave him ſuch a raviſhing deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his tendereſt affections, and painted the pleaſures he had taken that Evening ſo much to the life, adding his ſighs and exclamations, with geſtures and looks ſo eloquent and paſſionate, that he awaked in the Soul of the <hi>Baſſa</hi> the affection he had formerly for <hi>Laura,</hi> and lately laid aſleep. What care ſoever is taken to cure one of this paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, ſtill there remains enough in the Heart of a Lover to ſet it on fire by the leaſt ſpark that falls on it. The inſenſibility and reſiſtance of <hi>Laura</hi> had not Ice enough in them to quench all the heat of the <hi>Baſſa</hi>'s affection. She had only cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it with aſhes, to preſerve it the better againſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother time: Had the Count acted like a Politick Lover, he had eaſily fore-ſeen, how tickliſh and dangerous a buſineſs it is, to make ſuch repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations before Perſons who are amorouſly inclin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and eſpecially before a Man whom he had reaſon to conſider as a Rival, and in whoſe Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er it was to diſpoſe of him as he pleaſed. But the truth is, that in ſpeaking thus of <hi>Laura,</hi> he thought he hazarded nothing of his own; he had really no kindneſs for her, but hoped to do his own
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:60459:197"/>
buſineſs the better, in making the <hi>Baſſa</hi> believe that he lov'd her; which is the reaſon he did not carry himſelf in this with ſo much caution, as he would have done in another conjuncture.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Baſſa</hi> ſlept not that Night. <hi>Laura</hi> appear'd a thouſand times more handſom and charming, in the deſcription of the Count, than ever ſhe had done in his Eye at full ſight. He eſteemed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the moſt unfortunate of Men, not only for that he had quitted the purſuit, but had contributed ſo much to ſee her in the Arms of another: Hereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on jealouſie preſently poſſeſt him, attended with a train of ſpite, rage, and peeviſhneſs to torment him. What greater ſhame, thought he, could ever happen to a Man as he was, who never found re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance from a Woman, than to have been ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a Slave, who was his dependent, and had yielded to another Slave as ſoon as ſhe had ſeen him? For after the paſſionate relation <hi>Alexander</hi> had made, the <hi>Baſſa</hi> made no doubt but all was concluded; he had fancies of this kind that trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled him extreamly: and if he did not then hate the Count, 'tis certain, he retained not for him that kindneſs he had formerly expreſt towards him: And as for <hi>Laura,</hi> though he was then more in Love with her than ever, he had a pique againſt her, and could not forbear reproaching her all Night, for her want of diſcretion, in making grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter account of a mans kindneſs, that could do her no Service, than of his, by whom ſhe might have made her Fortune. Theſe thoughts were followed by others concerning his Perſon. He accuſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of baſeneſs, and weakneſs of Heart, to trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble himſelf with the thoughts of a Creature that ſo little deſerved his eſteem, or to intend to hinder
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:60459:197"/>
the ſatisfaction of two Lovers, whoſe Love he himſelf had cauſed and promoted. All this not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, he went on the morrow with the Count to the <hi>Seraglio;</hi> but for no other end, but to obſerve the countenance of <hi>Laura,</hi> who ſurpriz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſee him come: <hi>This is extraordinary, Sir,</hi> ſaid ſhe laughing, <hi>twice in one week: What will People ſay of it? As for you, ſaid the</hi> Baſſa, <hi>you will ſay no ill of it, I come in ſo good Company; and ſhould others believe as formerly, that I come for love of you, you know tis not for my ſelf, and therefore you are the more obliged to me. Laura</hi> very civilly thanked him for his goodneſs. They fell then all three into a little diſcourſe of Gallan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, wherein the <hi>Baſſa</hi> ſpoke ſo many kind things to <hi>Laura,</hi> that ſhe might underſtand part of that Amorous trouble he was in, if ſhe had miſtruſted it; but he delivered himſelf with ſuch an air, that his Complements, and kind Expreſſions were taken for meer effects of his good humour. But the <hi>Baſſa</hi>'s coming thither, being under pretence of ſeeing the <hi>Sultaneſs,</hi> he could not diſpence without giving her a Viſit; but he was not long with her, being not able to reſt till he return'd to the two Lovers, which he did with all the ſpeed in his power. He told <hi>Laura</hi> a thouſand things more obliging than formerly; and having highly ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſſed her, gave her at parting ſuch a look, that if ſhe had made the leaſt reflection upon it, ſhe might have eaſily perceived the kindneſs he had formerly for her took fire afreſh with more vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence than ever; but ſhe could not ſuſpect in the leaſt he would trouble her any more, after the kindneſs he had expreſt for his <hi>Alexander,</hi> and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been the inſtrument of the pretended Paſſion
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:60459:198"/>
between her and the Count. She took all for Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantry, and made it the ſubject of raillery with the <hi>Sultaneſs,</hi> to whom ſhe gave an account of all that had paſt with the <hi>Baſſa,</hi> and with <hi>Alexander.</hi> The fair <hi>Turk</hi> went that Evening to bed, ill ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with her fate, having been diſappointed of an Entertainment ſhe had expected, as pleaſant as that ſhe had received the day before from her dear Chriſtian; ſhe could not ſufficiently lament the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luckineſs of the Viſit given her by a man who Courted other Women, and ſeemed to have been born to incommode and give trouble only to her. <hi>Laura</hi> anſwered in raillery, She had little reaſon to complain of it to her, to whoſe complaiſance ſhe was beholding for a ſight of her Lover: <hi>Ah</hi> Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra, ſaid the <hi>Sultaneſs, who knows for what reaſon he hath been ſo complaiſant: You may very well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, it was not to oblige me. I believe ſo,</hi> Madam; <hi>replyed</hi> Laura, <hi>but you are obliged to him however, and ought to thank him for me.</hi> After this little raillery, they fell to diſcourſe, what could have brought the <hi>Baſſa</hi> thither that evening; and could not imagine, but it was in Complement to the Count.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Baſſa</hi> by this time was fallen into a deep Melancholy, ſeldom appearing, but when he walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Garden, ſometimes alone, and ſometimes with <hi>Alexander,</hi> and then not a word of <hi>Laura,</hi> nor any diſcourſe of going again to the Apartment of the <hi>Sultaneſs:</hi> This troubled our Lover, who beſides his affliction for being deprived of the ſight of a Perſon he loved better than his Life, and cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to ſee her, muſt ceaſe alſo to live; had a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand tormenting ſurmiſes and troubleſome fancies upon the <hi>Baſſa</hi> s change of humour, which he could
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:60459:198"/>
not attribute to any thing but his having taken ſome umbrage and jealouſie of him, on the account of the <hi>Sultaneſs.</hi> The <hi>Sultaneſs</hi> and her Confident were no leſs tormented on the other hand; they had ſeen a firſt, a ſecond, a third, and a fourth long day paſs without a ſight of their <hi>Alexander:</hi> Lovers are very exact Accomptants, and keep reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oning of the very moments, but account nothing more tedious than a day of abſence. What ſhould be the meaning of all this, ſaid they one to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, having a thouſand fears upon them, though they knew not of what: 'tis a difficult matter to keep any thing ſecret in places of that nature Yet they could not imagine they had given any occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of diſcourſe, or that any Perſon in the Apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment had made the leaſt diſcovery of their Intrigue. At laſt, on the fifth day, after abundance of Affliction, the <hi>Baſſa</hi> came to ſee them; but, the miſchief of it was, that he came alone. Beſides he appeared ſo dull, ſo muſing, and ſo much out of humour, they made no more doubt but he had ſmelt out the Intelligence they held with the Count. But that which gave them the killing blow, and raiſed their fears to the height, was, that <hi>Laura</hi> having, according to her cuſtom, waited the <hi>Baſſa</hi> out of the Chamber, and asked him, what he had done with her dear <hi>Eunuch?</hi> I am jealous of him (ſaid the <hi>Baſſa,</hi> making no ſtay) I need tell you no more: <hi>Laura</hi> made haſt to give her <hi>Miſtreſs</hi> the Alarm, and told her, there was no more doubt to be made, but jealouſie was the cauſe of the <hi>Baſſa</hi>'s not bringing <hi>Alexander</hi> with him, the <hi>Baſſa</hi> himſelf having told her ſo that inſtant; thoſe who are guilty, are eaſily frightned, and fear hath this property, that it ſo confounds the imagination,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:60459:199"/>
that the lighteſt ſuſpicions are taken for clear and unqueſtionable truths. With what ſighs, what tears did the poor <hi>Sultaneſs</hi> afflict her ſelf; yet not ſo much for the ill conſequences ſhe might appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend from the jealouſie of the <hi>Baſſa,</hi> as for the fear ſhe had, that if he were really jealous of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, ſhe ſhould never have a ſight of him more. She did heartily wiſh ſhe could have written to him, but there are few truſty Meſſengers to be found in thoſe places, where there is cauſe to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſt every one you converſe with; and every Eye that ſees you, is a ſpy on your actions, at leaſt if not gained by Money or kindneſs, wherein, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all poſſible care, you may be deceived: as ſhe was in this trouble, <hi>Laura</hi> received a Note from the Count, brought her by an <hi>Eunuch,</hi> and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried it forthwith to ſhew it the <hi>Sultaneſs,</hi> being in theſe words.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Madam, the</hi> Baſſa <hi>every day more obliging than other, is pleaſed to grant me the honour of walking with you this Evening in the Garden of the</hi> Sera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glio. <hi>I know not whether you can diſpenſe with your ſelf till then. Let us take the hour you think moſt proper. He will be there with one of his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſes. Send me word, if you plaeſe, if I may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect this favour from you.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Baſſa</hi> would never have thought of this walk, but out of the extream deſire he had to know certainly, how <hi>Laura</hi> and <hi>Alexander</hi> ſtood affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed one to the other; and that he might inform him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of what they ſhould diſcourſe. The Garden was a place very fit for his deſign, eſpecially by Night, where he could hear without being ſeen. He had made the propoſal to the Count, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence he would receive it with a great deal of joy,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:60459:199"/>
which in appearance he did, but without hope of any great ſatisfaction from the Adventure, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſcarce probable the <hi>Sultaneſs</hi> would permit <hi>Laura</hi> to come. But that which really troubled him, was the opinion he had, the <hi>Baſſa</hi> was cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly jealous of his Wife, ſince he gave him ſo clear proof of his unwillingneſs that he ſhould ſee <hi>Laura</hi> at her Lodgings any more.</p>
                  <p>The Queſtion then was, how to write to the <hi>Slave,</hi> to diſpoſe her for the walk. But the Count having written the Billet, the <hi>Baſſa</hi> ſent it by an <hi>Eunuch,</hi> and ſtay'd for the Anſwer.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Sultaneſs</hi> read the Billet, and was of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with her Gallant; that it was for Love of her the <hi>Baſſa</hi> was unwilling he ſhould come any more to ſee <hi>Laura</hi> in her Apartment. It was long e're they came to a reſolution in the point, whether <hi>Laura</hi> ſhould agree to the aſſignation: <hi>Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra</hi> very wiſely thought it better not to go, but the <hi>Sultaneſs,</hi> wholly led by her Paſſion, and too deeply in Love, to act any thing with reaſon that concerned her affection, notwithſtanding any thing <hi>Laura</hi> could ſay, made her write him this Anſwer.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>It were to act the part of a very ill Perſon, to be all alone in the Garden, while others are diverting themſelves there: I conſent for pity, to come and bear you company, but on condition that you will be wiſe, and that we be at ſome diſtance from the</hi> Baſſa, <hi>becauſe I would not be known by her, that he brings with him. If you can promiſe me theſe two things, I am for you after the fourth Prayer, when the</hi> Sultaneſs <hi>is a Bed. Adieu.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This anſwer was beyond the expectation of the Count who rejoyced extreamly at the pleaſure he promiſed himſelf with the Slave, from the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:60459:200"/>
of the <hi>Sultaneſs,</hi> while they ſhould conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue in the Garden.</p>
                  <p>Night being come, and the fourth Prayer over, the <hi>Baſſa</hi> told him, he might go, and bring <hi>Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra</hi> to the Garden, while he went for one of his <hi>Miſtreſſes,</hi> who was lodged on the other ſide. It is the Cuſtom of the Grandees of that Country, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong a multitude of Women they have in their <hi>Seraglio,</hi> when they have not a particular inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for any one, to take this to day, and another to morrow; and having loſt the taſte of Love, to ſearch for Pleaſure in change and variety.</p>
                  <p>It may be eaſily imagined, that <hi>Alexander</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived this Commiſſion with a great deal of joy, and was in no ſmall haſte to go to the <hi>Sultaneſſes</hi> Lodgings. She who was charmed at the ſight of him, could not expreſs her joy without a thouſand tranſports of Love, and the moſt tender careſſes a moſt paſſionate Lady could poſſibly make her deareſt Lover. <hi>Alexander</hi> did his part to admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, not only returning tranſport for tranſport, and careſs for careſs, but excelling his pattern, Love working in him, or he in the <hi>Sultaneſs</hi> ſuch things as gave her very great ſatisfaction. It may be admired Peradventure that two Perſons ſo little acquainted, ſhould in ſo few days become ſo very good Friends. But we muſt know, Love in theſe hot Countries makes far quicker progreſs than in the cold, where the Winds, and the Snow, and the Rain ſpoil his Wings, and hinder his flight: Whereas on the contrary, the Sun is there almoſt ſtill at the height, and Love being a tender Infant, and going always naked, thrives there the better, where he finds hearts very well diſpoſed, and ready to take fire.</p>

                     <pb n="45" facs="tcp:60459:200"/>The Count, who could not ſtay long there, was willing to beſtow the ſmall time he had to ſpend with the <hi>Sultaneſs</hi> in gentle reproaches for her permitting <hi>Laura</hi> to come and walk with him. You have, ſaid he, a very good opinion of my Affection, <hi>Madam,</hi> or elſe you love me with a great deal of indifference, that this does not in the leaſt trouble you at all. The <hi>Sultaneſs</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, ſhe relied not ſo much on his Fidelity, as on <hi>Laura's</hi> Diſcretion, whom ſhe knew too well, to think ſhe would betray her. Look you to your ſelf, as for her I place a confidence in her, and if you do your Duty, I am perſwaded ſhe will not be wanting in hers. Having thus ſpoken, ſhe would not detain him longer for fear of the <hi>Baſſa,</hi> but retired to her Chamber The happy Lover, very well pleas'd with the lucky moment he had paſt with the <hi>Sultaneſs,</hi> asked <hi>Laura</hi> if ſhe were ready; She made him anſwer, he ſhould not ſtay for her longer than while ſhe fetched her <hi>Barnus,</hi> which is a kind of Hood that covers them from Head to Foot. The Count ſeeing her return mufled up in that garment, went his way before, according to their cuſtom there, and ſhe followed: He ſaid not a word to her while they were in the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> for fear of being over-heard, and diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered; but being arrived in the Garden, where they had liberty enough, <hi>Who will believe, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>but we made an Amorous aſſignation, being come to a place of Rendezvous ſo fit for the purpoſe. And the</hi> Baſſa <hi>will not fail to think us the happieſt Lovers in the World. Laura</hi> made him no anſwer, but kept on her way, till they came to the Bower that was aſſigned them at a convenient diſtance from the <hi>Baſſa</hi>'s, as <hi>Laura</hi>
                     <pb n="46" facs="tcp:60459:201"/>
had deſired. The Count gave her his hand, and knowing very well every turn' in thoſe Walks, which he viſited almoſt every day, he made her fit on a place of green Turf made for the purpoſe. <hi>Then,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>this, Madam, is to try a mans Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity with a Witneſs, to expoſe him to paſs part of the Night in ſuch a place as this with a Lady ſo beautiful as you. Surely the</hi> Sultaneſs <hi>will hence-forward reſt aſſured of my Paſſion.</hi> The Count made a pauſe, expecting her anſwer, but not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving a word from her, he proceeded, telling her, I thought we had not been ſo debarred the pleaſures of an Aſſignation, but we might have enjoy'd that of diſcourſe; but for ought I perceive, you mean to follow the faſhion of <hi>Turky;</hi> and ſince 'tis a favour in this Country for a Woman to ſhew her ſelf<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or ſpeak to a man, you will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive me of the one and the other: But while we are together, I pray let us live after the mode of our Country, which is far better than the <hi>Turk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh.</hi> To do otherwiſe with we, were altogether too rigorous, and more, I believe, than you have promiſed the <hi>Sultaneſs,</hi> or ſhe expects at your hands. Away, I beſeech you, ſaid he, taking her by the <hi>Barnus,</hi> with this uſeleſs Hood, and do me the favour to tell me ſome News of the <hi>Sulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;</hi> or if you pleaſe, of the Adventures brought you hither, which from the day I firſt had the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to ſee you, I have had an extream longing to ask you: This you will not deny me, if you think I may be any way uſeful to you, as I doubt not but I may, being your Country-man, and ſo well eſteemed by the <hi>Baſſa,</hi> as to be able to do you ſome Service. All this Diſcourſe ſo obliging for <hi>Laura,</hi> ſhe heard, without replying a word,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:60459:201"/>
or quitting her <hi>Barnus,</hi> as he had deſired. The Count ſeeing this, preſſed her no further, but with more ſerious air ſaid, if you deſire, <hi>Madam,</hi> to paſs the Evening in this manner, it will be very unfortunate for me; but I muſt comply. And removing a few paces from her, he went and ſat him down in a corner of the Bower, where he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued a while without ſpeaking a word. The fair Lady fetched a ſigh, as if ſhe had been diſpleaſed at his quitting her. The <hi>Count</hi> laying hold on that occaſion to be even with her, took his turn of tormenting, in not anſwering her ſighs. At laſt ſhe came to him, took him by the Arm, and embraced him, with many grimaces, as if ſhe would have turned all into ridicule. The <hi>Count</hi> fell a laughing, and ſaid, <hi>Madam,</hi> I beſeech you be ſatisfied with the Sacrifice I make to Love, without trying my patience any further; let us, if you pleaſe, have a little converſation, but an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer me when I ſpeak, for I do not love talking to my ſelf. But all would not do; ſhe laughed under her Hood, and took pleaſure in vexing him. The Count at laſt growing impatient; this is too much, <hi>Madam,</hi> ſaid he, and ſince you will needs laugh, I'le ſhew you a trick ſhall make you ſpeak in ſpight of your Heart; having ſaid ſo, he took her in his Arms, and not being able to take off her Hood, he uſed ſome Familiarities with her, would have forced ſpeech from a Maid of <hi>Laura</hi>'s Diſcretion and Modeſty: But the Lady was ſtill ſilent, and ſo little concerned, that ſhe ſcarce made any reſiſtance. At which the Count was extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſurpriz'd, and after all the eſteem he had for <hi>Laura,</hi> apprehended there might be a deſign in the buſineſs, and that he was abuſed: Then it was
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:60459:202"/>
he did all in his power to get ſight of her through a little glimmering of light that came into the Bower. Did the <hi>Sultaneſs</hi> know, ſaid he, the liberty you allow me, ſhe would give you no thanks for your ſilence, or your being ſhie of affording me a ſight of you, which it ſeems you do to give me occaſion to attempt greater matters, and deny me ſmall favours to grant me the principal The fair Lady not able to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend her ſelf longer, quitted her <hi>Barnus</hi> and having eſcap'd out of his hands, Ah, little Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, ſaid ſhe is this the Fidelity you have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed me? Oh Heavens <hi>Madam,</hi> ſaid he, is it you? t was the <hi>Sultaneſs</hi> her ſelf had taken <hi>Laura</hi>'s place<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and you may imagine what a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant ſurprize this was to the Count, who could not on the ſudden otherwiſe expreſs it than by his exclamations<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and running after her (who fled not too <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

Yes, anſwered ſhe (ſuffering her ſelf to be gently brought back into the Bower) it is I, who repent me already of what I have done for you, who did not deſerve it. Did you think me ſo ſimple, to expoſe into the hands of another, that which I hold moſt dear in the World? Do not I ſee how ill it is truſting of you? Your Conſtancy was very tottering; it was at leaſt half overcome. And had <hi>Laura,</hi> the counterfeit <hi>Laura</hi> anſwered your offers, where would you have been? Never was Man more confounded than the <hi>Count</hi> at all theſe Reproaches: He made a free Confeſſion, but excuſed himſelf by her carriage towards him,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:60459:202"/>
alledging it impoſſible for any Man to have with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood the attaques ſhe had made. At laſt, he carried the Cauſe, all was accommodated, and Agreement made, and Love ſinged the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles.</p>
                  <p>To come in ſearch of a Gallant (as the <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taneſs</hi> had done) into a Garden where ſhe knew her Husband was preſent, was an Adventure ſomewhat bold: And doubtleſs, there are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Women who will condemn her conduct as imprudent; but of thoſe who are in Love there, are few, who being in her place, would not take the ſame courſe. The <hi>Baſſa,</hi> though ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with a very Beautiful Perſon, paſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way time ſomewhat worſe than the Count: <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bania</hi> his <hi>Miſtreſs</hi> had (beſides Beauty) an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Wit, and a very taking carriage, which made her paſs for the moſt charming Perſon in the <hi>Seraglio.</hi> The <hi>Baſſa</hi> had formerly been deeply in Love with her; but Love for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience is not very durable: Her Patron was not in an humour to Entertain her that Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and had not brought her with him into the Garden, but to ſerve for a pretence to colour o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther deſigns; ſhe apprehended as much, as ſoon as ſhe knew that <hi>Laura</hi> was in the Garden, which the <hi>Baſſa</hi> unluckily told her, thinking he might ſatisfie her in that point, by letting her know that <hi>Laura</hi> was deeply in Love with <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander,</hi> in whoſe company ſhe was. But <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bania</hi> was ſo far from believing it, that ſhe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently fancied <hi>Alexander</hi> to be no other than the <hi>Baſſa</hi>'s Confident in the Affair, and that he had not brought <hi>Laura</hi> into the Garden but for his Maſter: She had been formerly jealous of him,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:60459:203"/>
even to diſtraction, and I know not how it came to paſs the <hi>Baſſa</hi> was ſo overſeen, as not to have made choice of ſome other of his Women, who might have been more for his turn on this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion: She was at her wits end for the ſmall countenance he gave her; all the while he was with her ſhe had ſcarcely four words from him, and ſaw clearly his thoughts were wholly of <hi>Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra.</hi> This was vexation enough for a Woman in Love, who knows her ſelf handſom, and is high ſpirited withal. But that which put her into abſolute deſpair, was, that the <hi>Baſſa</hi> not able to obtain any truce from his jealouſie, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſpent ſome time in her company, without any careſs, or giving her the leaſt evidence of kindneſs, though ſhe had more than once gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him occaſion to ſhew it; told her, he had a longing deſire to go and hearken, and know how the Chriſtians in the Bower entertained one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: She made him no anſwer, but letting him go, ſhe the next minute after went another way towards the ſame Bower to obſerve the <hi>Baſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa,</hi> and ſee what he did there.</p>
                  <p>The Nights in that Country are very clear, eſpecially in Summer: The <hi>Baſſa,</hi> notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all the caution he had uſed to poſt himſelf ſecurely near <hi>Alexander</hi>'s quarter, under the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of the Hedges, that covered his approach, was perceived by the counterfeit <hi>Laura</hi> in the Bower. She had diſcovered him by his ſhaddow, and having made her lover aware of it, he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently went out, and ran to meet the <hi>Baſſa,</hi> to intreat him not to come any further, but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit him to enjoy that moment of pleaſure he had been pleaſed to procure him. The <hi>Sulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi>
                     <pb n="51" facs="tcp:60459:203"/>
not knowing what wind had brought the <hi>Baſſa</hi> to that ſide of the Garden, and fearing he would come into the Bower, would not be perſwaded by any thing that <hi>Alexander</hi> could ſay to her, to ſtay after him in the Bower, but preſently went out to hide her ſelf in ſome corner of the Garden, where ſhe might be in better ſecurity.</p>
                  <p>The mean time the jealous <hi>Baſſa,</hi> confound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the diſcovery, and having loſt the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of executing the deſign he had ſo unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunately laid, ſuffered himſelf to be prevailed upon by the intreaties of his Rival, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned towards his Bower, as <hi>Alexander</hi> to his; where being arrived, he was ſufficiently amaz<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

You would fain have made me run all about the Garden in ſearch of you:</hi> She anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not a word<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but getting out of his arms, ſhe went away briskly, and withdrew into another corner of the Bower: the Count was ſurprized at this manner of proceeding, being not ſo gentle as he expected from the <hi>Sultaneſs,</hi> who loved him ſo tenderly; but to undeceive him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf as ſoon as he could, and to find out the cauſe of ſo ſudden a change, he went up to her
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:60459:204"/>
the ſecond time, and taking her by the hand; <hi>What may be the reaſon, Madam,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>that you run away, and hide your ſelf from me? there is no fear of the</hi> Baſſa; <hi>he is withdrawn to his quater, and bath promiſed not to give us any further diſturbance.</hi> But all this could not make her anſwer a word; ſo that not knowing what to think of this rigour, he kneeled on the ground where ſhe was ſitting on a ſeat of green Turf, and kiſſing her hand, prayed her for loves ſake, to tell him the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why ſhe ſeemed angry with him; he court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and imbraced her with great paſſion and tenderneſs, and ſhe as patiently took it, but at laſt perceiving her laugh a laughter very different from that of the <hi>Sultaneſs,</hi> he examined her more nearly, and knew by the difference of her ſhape, and her Cloaths, that he was miſtaken. It was inconceivable, what a trouble this put him in. He thought himſelf arrived in Fairy-land, to ſee the ſtrangeſt ſights in the World. That <hi>Laura</hi> had been changed into the <hi>Sultaneſs,</hi> was not ſo ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing as pleaſant, but that the <hi>Sultaneſs</hi> ſhould be turned into another Woman, and perhaps a <hi>Miſtreſs</hi> of the <hi>Baſſa</hi>'s, this was the thing he could not comprehend: that which troubled him moſt, and extreamly diſquieted him, was the pain he was in, for not knowing what was become of the <hi>Sultaneſs;</hi> and the fear he had, the <hi>Baſſa</hi> might have met her in the Garden, and known her: this moved him again to go out in ſearch of her, but <hi>Chabanea</hi> (for it was ſhe he had miſtaken for the <hi>Sultaneſs</hi>) held him faſt by the ſleeve, and ſtaid him, telling him in the <hi>Moors</hi> Language, it was not fit for him to quit in that manner a Lady for whom he had already expreſs'd ſome affection.
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:60459:204"/>
The Count underſtood not her language, prayed her to let him go for fear the <hi>Baſſa</hi> ſhould come, and be offended at his being with her. But all to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, ſhe no more underſtood his <hi>Italian,</hi> than he her <hi>Moreſque,</hi> and was ſo far from letting him go, that ſhe would have made him ſit by her, that ſhe might revenge her ſelf on the <hi>Baſſa</hi> for the ſlight he had put upon her. During this little conteſt, which could not but be ſome what extraordinary be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween two Perſons who underſtood not one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the <hi>Sultaneſs</hi> comes in quiet out of breath, and throws her ſelf half dead into the arms of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander,</hi> who happened to be in a place ready to receive her. What frightful fancies had he then in his head? He preſenly imagined they were ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly undone, and that ſhe had been diſcovered. But the <hi>Baſſa</hi> arriving preſently after, ſet him right again, in ſaying, you run away <hi>Madam,</hi> ſpeaking to the counterfeit <hi>Laura,</hi> from a Perſon who wiſhes you no ill, nor intends you any; then turning towards <hi>Alexander,</hi> he was about to excuſe himſelf to him for breaking his word, but ſeeing <hi>Chabania</hi> ſtand by him, he ſuddenly altered both his mind and his Language, asking her in <hi>Moreſque</hi> what ſhe was come thither for. She anſwered him aloud, and gave him a thouſand reproaches for his unworthineſs and weakneſs in quitting her, to follow a Slave that run away from him. This was a very rare Scene, and the Dialogue not a little pleaſing to the <hi>Sultaneſs;</hi> but ſhe had not long to laugh at it, for <hi>Chabania</hi> being vext to the heart for the ſlight the <hi>Baſſa</hi> had put upon her, and for what he had ſaid to her before her pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended rival, flew like a Fury upon the <hi>Sultaneſs,</hi> with that promptitude and ſwiftneſs, that neither the <hi>Baſſa,</hi> nor <hi>Alexander<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> who would have ſtaid
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:60459:205"/>
her, were able to ſave the counterfeit <hi>Laura</hi> from being ſomewhat ill handled The Count was touched to the quick at this out-rage, and no conſideration of life or of duty, could have prevented him from having ſatisfaction, had not his fear of loſing the <hi>Sultaneſs</hi> prevailed more upon him than his reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The <hi>Baſſa</hi> was as angry as he, and tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the enraged <hi>Chabania</hi> by the hand, he drew her ſomewhat rudely out of the Bower, and led her away.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Count</hi> was no ſooner alone with the <hi>Sulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> but embracing her tenderly, <hi>Madam,</hi> ſaid he, with a paſſionate tone, <hi>what dangers have you gone through for love of me! what a cruel aſſault have you but now endured?</hi> The <hi>Sultaneſs</hi> did nothing but laugh at the laſt adventure ſhe had been in, and told him ſhe took more pleaſure to ſee <hi>Chabania</hi>'s deſpair, (for whom ſhe had ever a natural averſion) than ſhe had ſuffered of harm by her outrage and violence. But ſhe confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the ſame time, that ſhe was in extream perplexity when ſhe met with the <hi>Baſſa</hi> rang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over the Garden in ſearch of that Woman, and that it was the higheſt piece of good for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune imaginable, that ſhe had her <hi>Barnus</hi> with her, to hide her ſelf in. She added that her dear Husband had ſaid to her a thouſand gallant things, and had done alſo ſome things a little extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; but that it was her good fortune to be not far from the Bower, and to make her eſcape: She told him further, that there remained no more doubt of the <hi>Baſſa</hi>'s being newly fallen in love with <hi>Laura,</hi> and that ſhe was very well aſſured of it by the kindneſs of his expreſſions, and the tranſports ſhe obſerved him in at this ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter;
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:60459:205"/>
that this was the true cauſe of all their alarms, and the reaſon why he brought him not into the <hi>Seraglio</hi> as formerly: The <hi>Count</hi> was of the ſame judgment, and both held it neceſſary to make good uſe of the occaſion, and that <hi>Laura</hi> who was to act the principal part, ſhould imploy her beſt addreſs and complaiſance in their favour.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Baſſa</hi> taking ſmall pleaſure in the Garden after the unhappy ſucceſs of his amorous deſigns, having done his endeavour to pacifie <hi>Chabania,</hi> would bring her back to her Lodgings, and paſs'd by <hi>Alexander</hi>'s Bower, to let him underſtand it was time to withdraw. The <hi>Count</hi> followed him im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately, being extreamly joyful to have come off ſo happily from a walk that had prov'd ſo full of adventures: He bore his dear <hi>Sultaneſs</hi> company into her Apartment, where he ſtaid not long for fear of the <hi>Baſſa,</hi> but withdrew to his lodging. He paſt the reſt of the night very pleaſantly, though he ſlept not at all; and the truth is, he had reaſon enough to be well pleaſed, though his Patron had not, who was more labouring under mortal afflictions: <hi>Laura,</hi> whom he now was more deeply in Love with than ever, put him in deſpair by her Rigours and Cruelties: if no more pity from her, then no more pleaſure to be expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his life. His great affection for <hi>Alexander</hi> could not keep him from being his rival, and wiſhing to ſhare with him in the favours ſhe did him. His paſſion was arrived at a point which is the higheſt of ſufferings, that of not being loved: and when he thought of the opportunity he had let ſlip the night before, when he had <hi>Laura</hi> in his power, he was ſo cruelly vext, he could have found in his heart to be revenged of himſelf: yet he had

He was not willing to declare him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to <hi>Alexander,</hi> nor acquaint him with the thoughts he had newly entertained, as well to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the diſpleaſure he believed it would give him, as for that he conceived the <hi>Count</hi> might be of uſe to him in the deſign, and that the diſcovery might be to his prejudice.</p>
                  <p>In the Morning as ſoon as he was up, he went (as he ſometimes was uſed) to the <hi>Count</hi>'s Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber without any attendant, and found him in bed: <hi>A Man</hi> ſaid he, <hi>muſt be as happy as</hi> Alexander <hi>in his Love, before he can ſleep as quietly as he.</hi> If there be any anſwered the <hi>Count,</hi> hath cauſe to commend his good fortune on that account, it muſt without doubt be a Perſon of your comlineſs and Gallantry, who to gain love, need no more than ſay you are in love. Yes, replyed the <hi>Baſſa,</hi> with a ſmile, except it be to <hi>Laura,</hi> who hath made me very ſenſible that I can ſigh to no purpoſe, and that the maſter of her perſon may not be the maſter of her heart; It was neceſſary that <hi>Alexander</hi> ſhould come from <hi>Europe</hi> to <hi>Africk</hi> to make that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt: This, Sir, replyed the <hi>Count,</hi> may be an inſtance of the Vagaries and Extravagancies of Love, who often knows not where to fix, but fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows the effects of deſtiny, or the Stars which are predominant over the affections. And I believe Sir, added he ſmilling, as for the Love of <hi>Laura,</hi> you are already very well ſatisfied, and ſo little concerned where ſhe beſtows it, that you never deſigned to make me in Love with her, that you might be my Rival. However, ſaid he, obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:60459:206"/>
the <hi>Baſſa</hi> ſigh, I aſſure you, ſhould it ſo hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, you cannot do me a greater favour than in letting me know it. And you ſhall find that all the paſſion I can have for her, ſhall not hinder any performance of the duty I owe you. I will quit all my pretentions as I know you have the leaſt deſign upon her, that I may prevent all diſpute with a Perſon to whom I am ſo deeply oblig'd, that there can be nothing ſo dear to me, but I will part with it for your ſake. Believe it <hi>Alexander,</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered the <hi>Baſſa,</hi> it is not ſo eaſie a matter to be diſingaged from a paſſion like yours: you may as well perſwade me, you cannot be in Love. I am certainly in Love, replied the <hi>Count,</hi> and it may be as deeply as poſſible; but having ſo many fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours daily heaped on me from you, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the World I ſhall Love more than your repoſe and ſatisfaction: And, Sir, if <hi>Laura</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear now as amiable as formerly to you, I muſt tell you again, I love her no longer; ſo eaſie a matter was it for the ſubtile <hi>Italian</hi> to be generous in parting with that in which he was ſo little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned. The <hi>Baſſa</hi> asked him if he would ſay as much before <hi>Laura.</hi> He anſwered, he believed him too juſt and too gallant to deſire him to make a declaration of that nature before one who had been his <hi>Miſtreſs.</hi> At laſt the <hi>Baſſa</hi> propoſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother walk in the Garden that very day, and at the ſame time prayed him to write about it to <hi>Laura;</hi> which the Count having not been able to avoid, received his anſwer.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The burnt child dreads the fire; we do not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly expoſe our ſelves twice to the ſame danger. The</hi> Baſſa<hi>'s uſage of me laſt night, gives me ſmall encouragement to truſt him the ſecond time. And
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:60459:207"/>
you are an eye witneſs how ill I was handled by her he had with him. Let it ſatisfie you, that if you come hither, I will have the honour to ſee you. But no more walking.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Baſſa</hi> much troubled at ſo unexpected an anſwer, went out of the Counts Chamber without ſaying a word, and paſs'd in ſolitude the reſt of the day. But in the Evening he went to the <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taneſs,</hi> where he preſently met <hi>Laura;</hi> who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring of <hi>Alexander,</hi> and why he had not brought him with him; would it diſpleaſe you, ſaid the <hi>Baſſa,</hi> if I ſupplied his place this Evening: that were too great an honour for me, replied <hi>Laura</hi> ſmiling but the <hi>Sultaneſs</hi> expects you, and is not very well. The <hi>Baſſa</hi> gave her his hand, and would have led her into a private Chamber; <hi>Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra</hi> perceiving it, and that he was in good earneſt, prayed him to let her go; that her Lady was not well, and he knew well enough ſhe could not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure her being a moment out of her ſight: I, I, replied the <hi>Baſſa,</hi> the <hi>Sultaneſs</hi> is ſick, and cannot be a moment without you; but 'tis becauſe 'tis! deſire to paſs that moment with you; had it been <hi>Alexander</hi> you could have ſtaid a little longer. The <hi>Baſſa</hi> ſaid this with ſo pleaſant a tone, ſhe could not forbear laughing. You know Sir, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied ſhe, 'tis another caſe when you are with the <hi>Sultaneſs.</hi> Beſides Sir, added ſhe ſmiling, one would venture a little for a Sweet-heart: Well, well, ſaid he, preſſing her to go along with him, 'tis love hath brought me hither: I, Sir, anſwer'd ſhe, ſtriving to get away from him, and 'tis Love obliges me to avoid the occaſion of being found a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone in your company; for though I know you a moſt accompliſhed Perſon, you will allow me to
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:60459:207"/>
tell you, you have not too much reſpect for our Sex, and 'tis very hard truſting you, witneſs your aſſaults laſt night in the Garden. The <hi>Baſſa</hi> made her a thouſand Oaths he would keep within the bounds of that reſpect and diſcretion ſhe might ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect from the ſevereſt vertue, and proteſted he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired only one quarter of an hours diſcourſe. <hi>Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra,</hi> who knew the violence and obſtinacy of his humour, when denyed any thing he held reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to be granted him, diſpoſed her ſelf to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain him that quarter of an hour. He reproached her a thouſand times for her hardneſs and cruelty againſt him, and gave her withal the kindeſt words and the moſt tender and paſſionate expreſſions ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable. <hi>Laura,</hi> to defend her ſelf, pleaded her Honour, her Religion, and her Duty to the <hi>Sultaneſs</hi> her <hi>Miſtreſs;</hi> three things ſhe would not betray for the World: Had you but a little Love for me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſaid the <hi>Baſſa</hi> with a ſigh, you would not find ſo many reaſons for defence. I have my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion as you have yours, and the Precepts of it perhaps as ſevere as yours; but Love is ſtronger than all the Precepts, the Laws, the Religions of the World, and thoſe who ſerve him, worſhip no other God. As for the <hi>Sultaneſs,</hi> how are you concerned, that is my buſineſs, not yours; and it ſhall be your fault, if ever ſhe know it. But what do you tell me of Honour?</p>
                  <p>Surely 'tis more for your Honour to love a Man as I am, than to love ſuch a one as <hi>Alexander.</hi> You miſtake your ſelf, Sir, anſwered <hi>Laura,</hi> if you think that in the viſits he hath made me, there hath any thing paſs'd contrary to my duty. 'Tis not with thoſe of our Nation, as with the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of this Country: We may be together,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:60459:208"/>
and no body by, yet my Honour ſecure. I ſwear to you, Sir, <hi>Alexander</hi> never received that favour from me, which I could not afford the Perſon for whom I am the leaſt concerned in the World. The <hi>Baſſa</hi> interrupted her; what, not in the Garden? Neither in the Garden, nor any where elſe, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed ſhe, had he ever any other advantage than a ſight of me, which with us is accounted for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. Can you make me believe, anſwered the <hi>Baſſa,</hi> what you ſay? <hi>Laura</hi> told him there was nothing more true, and he might reſt aſſured of it: But Sir, ſaid ſhe, for your better ſatisfaction, bring him no more hither, and you ſhall ſee whether I make my complaint for it: 'Twere pity, reply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the <hi>Baſſa,</hi> to deſtroy ſo fair a friendſhip; and I do proteſt to you, that were it in my power, I would give you no trouble, but I am not ſo much Maſter of my ſelf, to gain this point on my heart, to be unconcerned in your Love: But ſince you love <hi>Alexander</hi> with ſo much indifference, that you can ſo eaſily reſolve not to ſee him more, I have no cauſe to afflict my ſelf, but rather to hope you may one day love me perhaps as much as you do him.</p>
                  <p>After theſe words the <hi>Baſſa</hi> retired, with a heart a little better at eaſe than when he came in, but as deeply in Love as before. He gave not an intire and firm credit to what <hi>Laura</hi> had told him of her indifference and ſmall concernment for <hi>Alexander,</hi> but did believe her paſſion for the Chriſtian not ſo great as he had imagined, or that their Love had been cooled by ſome quarrel, for he had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved on the one ſide and the other, more indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence than is uſually conſiſtent with that paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="61" facs="tcp:60459:208"/>But then reflecting ſuddenly on himſelf, may not this be (ſaid he, reſuming his jealouſie and diffidence,) an effect of their policy? may they not be agreed to deceive me? and being already ſufficiently aſſured of one anothers affections, may they not pretend they have no Love for one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that they may Love one another with grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſecurity? No, no, adds he, this cannot be<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> there is no hiding of Love, it will appear if not ſmothered to death: She loves not <hi>Alexander</hi> at all, or loves him but indifferently; thus he the more eaſily perſwaded himſelf to be ſo, in that he did moſt paſſionately deſire it might be ſo; and thence-forward his paſſion increaſed ſo faſt, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came greater than ever. Hope being a paſſion that more than any other foments that of Love, eaſily promiſes it ſelf happy events, and flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters it ſelf with expectation of good fortune and ſucceſs.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Laura</hi> gave the <hi>Sultaneſs</hi> an accompt of all the pleaſant diſcourſe; and the <hi>Sultaneſs</hi> could have wiſhed <hi>Laura</hi> had not been altogether ſo ſevere to the <hi>Baſſa,</hi> but a little more kind and complaiſant, without which ſhe thought they could not ſee <hi>Alexander</hi> ſo often as ſhe deſired. <hi>Laura</hi> on the contrary told her, that to have been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaiſant, would have ſpoyl'd all, for that the <hi>Baſſa</hi> would then have entertained ſome hopes of favour from her, and ſo become more amorous than before, and conſequently more jealous of his ſuppoſed Rival than ever. What ſhall I do then, ſaid the poor <hi>Sultaneſs,</hi> who can do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but fear, and cannot expect any thing but croſſes and misfortunes? <hi>Laura</hi> told her, things were not in ſo deſperate a condition, that
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:60459:209"/>
ſhe need trouble her ſelf for it, for the <hi>Baſſa</hi> had promiſed to ſend <hi>Alexander</hi> on the morrow<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that they would conſider with him how to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their buſineſs.</p>
                  <p>The Count did not know that the <hi>Baſſa</hi> had been with the <hi>Sultaneſs;</hi> but having not heard from him that day, he went on the morrow to wait on him at his riſing. He found him abed, ſo dejected and melancholly, that he might by his countenance eaſily diſcover the heavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his heart. Yet he received him with that air of kindneſs and friendſhip might well aſſure the Count he was not diſpleaſed with him. The <hi>Baſſa</hi> was ſilent a while, and then looking on the Count with an air of friendſhip and confidence; <hi>Alexander,</hi> ſaid he, I am the moſt unfortunate of men, eſpecially in Love. <hi>Laura,</hi> added he, ſighing, the cruel <hi>Laura</hi> hath not the leaſt ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs for me; no, not the leaſt pity for the torments ſhe ſees me ſuffer for her: and unleſs you will be a little kind to me, I know not what will become of me. Ah Sir, anſwered the Count, let me but know what you deſire of me, and what I can do for you: you know it is not in my power to diſpoſe of others hearts; but if I may contribute to your ſatisfaction; if you would have me ſpeak to her; if—How happy ſhould I be, ſaid the <hi>Baſſa,</hi> interrupting him, would you do what you can. Sir, replyed the Count, if it depend upon me, you may promiſe your ſelf ſucceſs. The <hi>Baſſa</hi> held his peace for a little time, as if he ſtudied what to ſay; but <hi>Alexander</hi> preſſing him to declare himſelf, he told him with ſome trouble, that he ſhould appoint an aſſignation with <hi>Laura</hi> in a Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:60459:209"/>
in the Apartment of the <hi>Sultaneſs,</hi> where the <hi>Baſſa</hi> might meet her in his ſtead. The Propoſal was ſo unworthy and unfit for <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> to conſent to, that it aſtoniſh'd him on the ſudden ſo extreamly, that having bluſh'd at it very much, he knew not what anſwer to make. The <hi>Baſſa</hi> obſerved the diſorder he was in, and was more out of countenance at it than the Count; but for fear he ſhould interpret it otherwiſe than intended, and taking his bluſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for no very good Omen, he told him, (to be rid of him) that he might go think of it, and that if he gave him any anſwer, it ſhould be a favourable one.</p>
                  <p>The Count went out of the Chamber, and made a thouſand reflections on his ill Fortune, which had reduced him to the extremity of mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him ſerve ſuch a perſon; not but that he was fully perſwaded, <hi>Laura</hi> would not come, and that he ſhould be little concerned, though ſhe ſhould entertain the motion, and favour the paſſion of his amorous Patron: But beſides the baſeneſs of the employment he put him upon, he was mad to think he took him for ſuch a Villain, that loving a Maid, as the <hi>Baſſa</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved he did <hi>Laura,</hi> could betray her ſo baſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. This was the only thing troubled him; nor would he have done it, though he died for it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Baſſa</hi> having ſeen him leave his Chamber in that manner, thought there was ſmall hope of effecting his deſign that way; yet being a perſon of great reaſon and worth, he was ſo far from thinking the worſe of the Count, or being offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with him on this occaſion, that he eſteemed of
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:60459:210"/>
him the better, and conſidered of other means to gain ſatisfaction to his love in the enjoyment of <hi>Laura.</hi> His paſſion was now arrived at a height beyond the power of reaſon to manage, and capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to put him on any enterprize whatever. The moſt vertuous of men when changed into a deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Lover, become the moſt furious and extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant of all; being ſo much more ſenſible of ſlights put upon him, as he conceives himſelf a perſon of merit.</p>
                  <p>This tranſported Lover having failed of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to make <hi>Alexander</hi> of his Party, to ſerve his ends in a Propoſal that included Treachery, reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to deceive <hi>Laura</hi> himſelf, by going to ſee her that night diſguiſed as an <hi>Eunuch.</hi> The deſign was not very well laid, but it took, as ſhall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear by the ſequel. He had not the patience to ſtay till his ordinary hour of going to the <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taneſs;</hi> but as ſoon as 'twas night, he went away diſguiſed like an <hi>Eunuch,</hi> and came to the apartment, where he found one old <hi>Moor</hi> at the gate, who not taking ſo much notice of him as to know him, he ſent her to <hi>Laura,</hi> to tell her that an <hi>Eunuch</hi> of her acquaintance deſired to ſpeak with her in the Chamber of Repoſe; ſo called becauſe it was retired, and far from noiſe, and the place where they uſed to take ſome hours reſt after dinner in Summer. He made choice of this Chamber as the moſt proper for his deſign; and the old Woman was no ſooner gone about her meſſage, but he went to hide him there. <hi>Laura</hi> was then buſie, and the <hi>Sultaneſs</hi> having caſually met the old Woman in ſearch of <hi>Laura,</hi> asked her, what ſhe would have with her? the old Woman having had no order to keep private
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:60459:210"/>
her buſineſs, told her freely, there was an <hi>Eunuch</hi> deſired to ſpeak with her in the Chamber of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. The <hi>Sultaneſs</hi> hearing of an <hi>Eunuch</hi> who would ſpeak with <hi>Laura,</hi> made no queſtion at all but <hi>Alexander</hi> was the Man; and without further enquiry what kind of Man the <hi>Eunuch</hi> was, or any other conſideration, ſhe takes <hi>Laura</hi>'s <hi>Barnus,</hi> and goes to the place of aſſignation; had ſhe made the leaſt reflection on the meſſage, ſhe could not have been ſo deceived, nor have expoſed her ſelf ſo eaſily to the danger ſhe went into. It was not the cuſtom of her Gallant to uſe her thus, or to ſee her any where but in the <hi>Alcove</hi>-chamber; he ſcarce knew the name of the Chamber where ſhe was told he ſtaid for <hi>Laura,</hi> and knowing what ſhe did of the <hi>Baſſa,</hi> ſhe had reaſon to miſtruſt him. But thoſe who are in Love as the <hi>Sultaneſs</hi> was, are ſubject to greater over-ſights than theſe. She knew that <hi>Alexander</hi> was not to ſee her but by night, yet ſhe waited for him from the firſt moment ſhe awoke in the morning; and in this amorous expectation, which tantalized her ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly, and kept her in a mortal inquietude whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he came or came not, there needed no help to hurry her away when the time drew near. Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men who have been in Love, will eaſily confeſs there is nothing ſo hard as to be prudent on ſuch occaſions, and that the name of their Gallant when expected, hath made them ſtart up for joy, and run to meet him e're they knew whether he were come.</p>
                  <p>The paſſionate <hi>Sultaneſs</hi> having given up her ſelf to be led blind-fold, where ſhe thought Love waited for her, borrowed wings of that God to carry her the ſooner into that Chamber; there was
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:60459:211"/>
not any light there, but this did not ſurprize her, it being not uſual to place any in that Chamber<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> She pleaſed her ſelf with the fancy of putting a Love-trick on <hi>Alexander,</hi> by making him take her once more for <hi>Laura,</hi> this made her reſolve to be ſilent a while, as ſhe had been in the Garden, and to divert her ſelf that way. But as ſhe was entring, ſhe was taken with a ſhivering all over, and ſuch a ſudden fear, that ſhe was on the point of going back again. But the Gallant who waited for her, having taken her by the Hand, ſhe began to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collect her ſelf, and went along with him where he pleas'd: he led her away to the further end of the Chamber, where he was ſo loath to loſe time for making uſe of the occaſion, that embracing her with ſome tranſport, though trembling withal, he had almoſt put it out of her power to defend her ſelf. The <hi>Sultaneſs</hi> thinking this action too vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent to be <hi>Alexander</hi>'s, began to miſtruſt; and having given him his liberty till then, ſhe did the utmoſt in her power to reſiſt him, and knew, though a little too late, that ſhe was abuſed, and that this Man had neither the ſhape, nor the ſtature, nor face of her <hi>Alexander,</hi> and that it muſt be the <hi>Baſſa,</hi> which ſome marks ſhe knew about him, ſoon put out of queſtion, ſhe changed her method, and ſtood upon her guard. The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance ſhe made after the kindneſs ſhe expreſt at the firſt, was obſerved by the Gallant, and made him perceive that the cheat was diſcovered, and no hopes of hiding himſelf. So that without further dallying he made his laſt efforts, and rendred thoſe of the <hi>Sultaneſs</hi> ſo uſeleſs, that he obtained his deſign. This tranſported Lover was happy at leaſt in conceit, which ſufficiently proves the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:60459:211"/>
of imagination, and that our greateſt pleaſures proceed from it. I am ſure, there is no unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Lover but may envy his miſtake, and that chance could not put a greater obligation on any Man, than this on the <hi>Baſſa.</hi> His paſſion thus ſatisfied, he withdrew, without ſaying a word, and the Lady made all the haſt ſhe could to her Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, for fear the paſſionate <hi>Baſſa</hi> ſhould renew the aſſault. <hi>Laura</hi> who had been much troubled at miſſing of her, was no leſs amazed to ſee her come in the condition ſhe was in, which made her throw her ſelf on the Bed; where half weeping, half laughing, ſhe told her the ſtory of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture: At which <hi>Laura</hi> did nothing but laugh; expecting very pleaſant concluſions from ſo comical beginnings.</p>
                  <p>The Count had been at the <hi>Baſſa</hi>'s in the Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and not finding him within, came on the Morrow to acquaint him with the reſolution he had taken on the propoſal. As he entred the apartment, he was told that the <hi>Baſſa</hi> had been ill that night, and had not ſlept at all, and that he had forbidden any entrance into his Chamber; but the Count having more priviledge than others, they let him paſs, and he found him abed, and writing, with ſo ſad a meen, and ſo dejected a countenance, that the Count preſently concluded he had had a very ill night; ſeeing <hi>Alexander</hi> on the ſudden, he coloured a little; but the Count laying one knee to the ground, I come, Sir, ſaid he, to beg one favour more of you: You are the principal Author of all the Love I am engaged in; it is my misfortune that you feel the ſame paſſion. Accept, I beſeech you, the ſacrifice I make you Sir, I will never love, and if you will have it ſo,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:60459:212"/>
I will never ſee <hi>Laura</hi> more. Bleſs me! cryed the <hi>Baſſa,</hi> what Lovers are theſe! is it poſible that two perſons who began to love one another with ſo tender affection, can part with ſuch eaſe? and that I, who am am not beloved, cannot bring my ſelf to this; ſpeak <hi>Alexander,</hi> and tell me whether it proceeds from any diſtaſt you have taken, or that you do it for my ſake. No Sir, anſwered the Count, <hi>Laura</hi> is this day as amiable in my eyes as the firſt day I ſaw her; but rather than ſee you in the condition I find you in, I will not ſpare the doing my ſelf any violence I am capable of; and for your quiet and my own, I heartily wiſh I never had ſeen her. This example is ſo rare, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed the <hi>Baſſa,</hi> that nothing leſs than the eſteem I have for you, can make it credible. In the mean time this Billet will let you ſee, that I have not ſtaid for you to ſet me a Preſident, but that I know in my turn how to give Preſidents for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to imitate, but not to out do. It is written to <hi>Laura,</hi> read it: And there it will appear to you, that if I have done you wrong, I know how to puniſh my ſelf for it. I ſhould be heartily ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, ſo virtuous and excellent a perſon as you, ſhould part from us, with an ill opinion of me. The Count extreamly ſurprized at this diſcourſe, not comprehending the reaſon of it, after an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer full of reſpect and acknowledgment to his dear Patron, took the Billet, and there read theſe words.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>If all the paſſion Man can have for a Woman, is not capable to juſtifie the crime I committed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt you, you ought to pardon me, at leaſt ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſuffered in one night all the torments<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and afflictions of a cruel repentance, which yet fills my
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:60459:212"/>
ſoul with grief and confuſion. And if by giving you and your Lover your Liberty, I may in ſome meaſure make amends for my faults, you may make you ready for your voyage, for to morrow morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you ſhall go both together. Farewell, and think of the violence I did my felf, in forcing from my boſom two perſons, whom of all I ever ſaw, I loved moſt entirely, and then you will find me not altogether unworthy of pardon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Count was ſo confounded at reading the Billet, as never was Man, and had much ado to hide the diſorder it put him in; he kneeled the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond time, as it were to give the <hi>Baſſa</hi> thanks for this laſt favour, which before his engagement in Love with the <hi>Sultaneſs,</hi> had been the greateſt he could have done him; but now after his paſſion, it was certainly the greateſt misfortune could befal him. He was willing by this action to hide from the <hi>Baſſa</hi> the trouble he was in. But the <hi>Baſſa</hi> took him up, and told him, he could not ſee him in that poſture, for a buſineſs where he had more cauſe to complain of him, than to thank him, that he ſhould know at leiſure the whole matter from <hi>Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra,</hi> and that in the mean time he had nothing to do but prepare for his Voyage; that he had given order to ſtay a Chriſtian Veſſel, which ſhould have gone off that very day for <hi>Italy,</hi> and ſhould land them at <hi>Legorn;</hi> that the weather was fair, and that without fail he ſhould embark with <hi>Laura</hi> on the morrow: for all which he gave him his word.</p>
                  <p>The Count having taken leave of the <hi>Baſſa</hi> went out of the Chamber with a heart ſo full of trouble and affliction, for the news he had received, that
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:60459:213"/>
he wanted a more proper place to comfort himſelf, and to vent his thoughts of the reſolution the <hi>Baſſa</hi> had taken to give him his Liberty, and to ſend <hi>Laura</hi> with him. He knew not what might have obliged him to a reſolution of this nature, though upon reading the Billet, he did imagine the <hi>Baſſa</hi> had committed ſome outrage on <hi>Laura;</hi> but this was not the thing troubled him; it was the <hi>Sulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> from whom he muſt part, and muſt bid her adieu for ever: to part with a Woman one loved ſo tenderly, to part with her for ever, and to part with her in the height of his paſſion, ſounds very harſh, and where is the Lover could take ſuch a reſolution for any reaſon what-ever? Yet Liberty, which to a Man who knows what 'tis to be a Slave, to a Man of <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi>'s quality, is a thing ſo attractive; to return to his Countrey after eight or nine months abſence; the pleaſure of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the conſideration that if he loſt this opportunity, he might perhaps never have ſuch another; all this, I ſay, made ſuch a Party, that the moſt beautiful, and moſt charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Lady in the World, could not have hindred many excellent Perſons from quitting hers to take it. But true Love which values nothing above its own ſatisfaction, ſlights a liberty to be bought with too many tears: yet in this conjuncture, it was almoſt impoſſible for <hi>Alexander</hi> to refuſe this cruel liberty, being all he could in appearance de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, and beſtowed on him by the <hi>Baſſa,</hi> with a <hi>Miſtreſs</hi> with whom he believed him paſſionately in love. What reaſon could he find to refuſe ſuch a Preſent which had coſt the <hi>Baſſa</hi> ſo dear, and ought to be the moſt acceptable to him? He de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpaired to find any, and ſaw clearly there was a neceſſity of parting, unleſs Love, favourable to Lovers in extremity, would come to his aid, and
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:60459:213"/>
make the <hi>Baſſa</hi> alter his reſolution, as they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly do who take any againſt love; never did Slave pay more Vows to be delivered from his Chain, than he did for the continuance of his Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity, chooſing rather to be a Slave the reſt of his Life, than to be for ever removed to ſuch a diſtance from that which he loved a thouſand times more than his Liberty.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Baſſa</hi> having paſſed ſome hours after in his Bed, to muſe upon the reſolution he had taken, which he adhered to, though it made his heart ake, called for his <hi>Aga,</hi> and gave him orders for the departure of the two Chriſtians, cauſing ſtore of Proviſions, and very rich Preſents to be carried on board the Veſſel; this done he ſent his chief <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuch</hi> to the <hi>Sultaneſs</hi> his Wife, to intreat her to give <hi>Laura</hi> her Liberty, whom he was minded to ſend home to her Country, together with <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> for reaſons of importance to her, as of neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty for him, and for the eaſe and repoſe of one and the other. Having given theſe orders, and the ſame time ſent the Letter he had written to <hi>Laura,</hi> he took Horſe for <hi>Bardou,</hi> one of his Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of Pleaſure, a mile from the Town, and ſtaid there till midnight, having all that time walked alone in the Gardens, to wean himſelf from the ſight and company of <hi>Alexander,</hi> and the pleaſure he took in <hi>Laura</hi>'s diſcourſe.</p>
                  <p>That night the <hi>Baſſa</hi> could not ſleep, and in the Morning his <hi>Aga</hi> being come to bring him an anſwer from the <hi>Sultaneſs,</hi> as to his requeſt for giving <hi>Laura</hi> her Liberty; he went preſently to carry it to <hi>Alexander,</hi> whom he found in appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance ready to be gone, but in truth never leſs diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, but hoping every moment ſome change of
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:60459:214"/>
reſolution in the <hi>Baſſa. Ah,</hi> Alexander, ſaid he, <hi>we muſt part, but I know not how we ſhall; for the</hi> Sultaneſs <hi>who loves</hi> Laura <hi>with the ſame affection I do you, notwithſtanding my repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to her how much ſhe was concerned in inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt to have us part, and to deſire it as much as I, cannot reſolve upon it, but hath ſent me word this Morning ſhe will ſooner loſe her life than her</hi> Laura. <hi>You muſt go ſee</hi> Laura, <hi>and tell her 'twill be her fault if ſhe be not free, and go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long with you; for as for me, what I have promiſed I will perform. In the mean time I will give order that the Veſſel be ſtaid longer, that it may not ſail without you. Sir,</hi> anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Alexander, <hi>there are frequent opportunities of Tranſportation, and when you have given ſome longer time to ſatisfie the</hi> Sultaneſs, <hi>and diſpoſe her to grant</hi> Laura <hi>this favour, our obligation then will not be leſs for our Liberty you are now pleaſed to grant us.</hi> Alexander replyed the Baſſa, <hi>reſolutions like that I have now taken in your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, go ſo much againſt the grain of a heart affected as mine, that delays may be dangerous, and time may make them faulter: make uſe of the good motions reaſon and equity have inſpired into me. I do not tell you my thoughts are unaltera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. The ſpite I have againſt my heart oft its weakneſs, the outrage I did</hi> Laura <hi>yeſterday; my ſhame to appear before her after it, and the ſmall hopes I have of gaining her Love, are the true cauſes of your good fortune: all this is yet freſh in my mind; ſtay not till time deface theſe impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, there being nothing men are apt ſo ſoon to forget, as the injuries they had done to others.</hi>

                     <pb n="73" facs="tcp:60459:214"/>As they were diſcourſing together, a huge Moor who ſerved as Purveyor for the <hi>Count,</hi> and brought him every Morning his Proviſion from the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> came on the ſudden into the Chamber with a great Basket on his head, not thinking (without doubt) of the <hi>Baſſa</hi>'s being there. The Moor ſtarted at the ſight of him, would have gone back, but the <hi>Baſſa</hi> with his hand made ſigns for him to ſtay; he obeyed, and laid the Basket on the ground, which appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed very heavy, and ſo he withdrew; the <hi>Baſſa,</hi> of pure curioſity to ſee what they had ſent <hi>Alexander</hi> to eat, bid a Moor, who waited in the Room, take up the Basket lid, which he did, and found the Proviſion to be a Woman very pleaſantly tucked up and mufled in her <hi>Barnus</hi> that ſhe might not be known. But being in the Habit of a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an (which the <hi>Baſſa</hi> and <hi>Alexander</hi> had formerly ſeen <hi>Laura</hi> in) they made no doubt but it was ſhe. The <hi>Baſſa</hi> at firſt was very much ſurprized, but then fell a laughing, and ſaid to the <hi>Count,</hi> the Invention is rare, and that ſhe had far more wit than the Women of that Country; but this is a product of Love the Father of Inventions. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, 'tis certain nothing could have been done more proper for our deſign: But ſhall not we ſee, ſaid he, all your Proviſion? <hi>Madam,</hi> you are here between the two beſt Friends you have in the World; and you have no reaſon to be ſhy of ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your ſelf; having ſaid this, he drew near to the Lady, and would have taken her by the arm to help her to riſe, but ſhe refuſed and thruſt him back. I ſee <hi>Madam,</hi> ſaid he, you have not yet granted me the pardon I begged of you. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs the offence was too great to be ſo quickly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given; but you are taking your leave, and it is
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:60459:215"/>
not fit we ſhould part without being friends; for it would be a perpetual grief to me, to ſee you leave this Country with hatred in your heart. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny not this favour (added he, reaching forth his hand) to a man reduced to deſpair for having of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended you, and puniſhing himſelf ſo ſeverely for the fault, that there is no need of this extream cruelty from you. But all he ſpoke was in vain, for ſhe hid her ſelf more cloſely, and fortify'd her ſelf in the Basket to prevent being ſeen. The <hi>Baſſa</hi> was unwilling to preſs her any further, but addreſſing himſelf to <hi>Alexander,</hi> told him, it was his part to make peace, and to prevail with <hi>Laura</hi> to let him ſee her once more being the laſt time<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The Count took it ill that ſhe made ſo ſhy of ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her ſelf to a Perſon to whom ſhe was too much obliged, to deny him his requeſt in ſuch a conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, what cauſe ſoever ſhe might have had of quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel againſt him. Beſides, he was particularly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned to preſs her to ſhew her ſelf; for the laſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge he had, was his hope that the <hi>Baſſa</hi>'s tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for her, would perhaps at the moment of part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing take fire afreſh, and make him change his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution; with theſe thoughts he went to her, and gave her all the reaſons he could invent to be reconciled to the <hi>Baſſa,</hi> and let him ſee her a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; but all to no purpoſe. He had not one word of anſwer, which angered him ſo, that hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taken her twice or thrice by the arm to make her riſe, he was juſt going to force up her <hi>Barnus,</hi> and threatned to do it; but the <hi>Baſſa</hi> would not ſuffer it, bidding him force her no further; that ſhe had cauſe enough to complain, without doing her new violence for love of him. But, ſays he, let us make uſe of the time, and ſince ſhe is brought
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:60459:215"/>
hither to our hands, and you have no more to do but embark, let us finiſh what we have begun, and perform what we have undertaken, there never can be a fairer opportunity; and I cannot think that <hi>Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra</hi> will be ſorry to leave ſuch a Country as this, or part with us to go along with you. The <hi>Sultaneſs</hi> in all probability is yet aſleep, let us not ſtay till ſhe awake. We muſt preſently carry <hi>Laura</hi> (as ſhe is in the Basket) into the Ship: you ſhall bear her company, and as ſoon as you arrive, you ſhall hoiſe ſail and away; as for me, I will paſs the reſt of the day at <hi>Bardou,</hi> and give out ſuch orders as may be neceſſary, that in caſe the <hi>Sultaneſs</hi> miſs <hi>Laura,</hi> and find ſhe is eſcaped, you may not be ſtaid. Having ſaid this, he ſent a Moor to the Port, with order to have a Shallop in readineſs to carry <hi>Laura</hi> and <hi>Alexander</hi> aboard the Chriſtian Veſſel riding at <hi>Gouletta.</hi> This done, he ſent for the Captain of his Guards, and bid him accompany the Count, and commend the care of that Basket to the Moors who were to carry it along. Having given theſe orders, he had no more to do, but bid his dear <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander</hi> adieu; and having embraced him with tears in his eyes, he bore him company to the Shal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lop, and from thence went to <hi>Bardou</hi> with a heart full of grief. The poor Count was more to be pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tied: He was not much concerned to expreſs how ſorry he was to part with the <hi>Baſſa;</hi> but as for the <hi>Sultaneſs,</hi> whom he could have wiſhed to have ſeen once more at leaſt, his trouble to leave her was ſo great, that he felt not the grief he ſhould have ſhewed when he bid the <hi>Baſſa</hi> adieu, who had ſo highly obliged him. When he ſaw he muſt part, and no hopes of ſeeing her, his heart was ſo full he could not ſpeak a word; the tears
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:60459:216"/>
ran down his cheeks, which much moved the good <hi>Baſſa,</hi> who thought they were ſhed for him, and was not diſpleaſed to ſee himſelf outdone by a Man who was not ungrateful, and cordially loved him: At laſt he ſaw him embarked, and bid him the laſt adieu. The afflicted Count was ſo op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd with grief, that from the Haven to <hi>Gou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>letta,</hi> having given his heart a little more liberty than he durſt have done in preſence of the <hi>Baſſa,</hi> he let fall ſuch lamentable expreſſions, looking to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Town, that the Captain of the Guard, and the reſt that accompanied him, were extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aſtoniſhed, and moved to compaſſion. By good luck they underſtood not <hi>Italian,</hi> but his geſtures, his tears, his looks, and the colour of his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance expreſſed an unparallel'd trouble and afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                  <p>He no ſooner got a board the Ship, but he threw himſelf on a Bed, and was ſo much beſide himſelf, that he did not as much as think of his Basket; but the Captain of the Guard had eaſed him of that care, and cauſed it to be carried into his Cabbin; after which he took leave of him, and having commanded the Captain of the Veſſel to hoiſe up his Sails, he went into the Shallop and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to <hi>Tunis;</hi> then was it that <hi>Alexander</hi> find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf alone in his Cabbin, abandoned himſelf to the torment of his grief. Ah Fate, ſaid he, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt Fate, what have I done that you uſe me ſo cruelly, that you force me away from a Perſon without whom I cannot live. Ah my <hi>Sultaneſs,</hi> dear <hi>Sultaneſs,</hi> muſt I leave you, muſt I abſent my ſelf from you for ever? For ever, ſaid he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, riſing up: Ah Heavens! let me rather be ſet
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:60459:216"/>
aſhore, I ſhall find pretence enough with the <hi>Baſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa;</hi> let me rather truſt Love than Fortune, ſhe hath betray'd me: Whatever happen I muſt die, and I had rather die at her feet whom I love, than at this cruel diſtance. Having ſaid this, he went to ſee if they were ſtill at Anchor, but found they were already a great way from Land, and ſailing with a favourable wind, had almoſt loſt ſight of <hi>Gouletta.</hi> What deſpair was he in? Ah my heart ſaid he, there is no remedy, now I muſt periſh. Dear <hi>Sultaneſs,</hi> added he, taking his Sword in his hand, ſee whether I am guilty of this abſence, and receive the Sacrifice I make you of my Life; with that he drew his Sword, and was going to thruſt himſelf through, when on a ſudden the Perſon in the Basket, who had thus far hearkned to all he had ſaid, threw her ſelf upon him to prevent fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther miſchief. Let me alone to finiſh a life which cannot but be unhappy at this diſtance from all that I love. Ah dear <hi>Alexander,</hi> anſwered the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, embracing him with all tenderneſs, her joy not permitting her to ſay any more. The Count finding immediately (notwithſtanding the trouble and tranſport he was in) ſome difference between this voice and <hi>Laura</hi> s, looked behind on the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy who held him in her arms: But what an aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, what a charming ſurprize was it for a heart like his, and in the condition he was in, to ſee that it was the <hi>Sultaneſs</hi> her ſelf?</p>

                  <p>The Happy Lover extreamly amazed at ſo ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing an Adventure, found in himſelf ſo ſudden an alteration from the depth of Grief to the height of Joy, that to enjoy more fully the preſent plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of ſo bleſſed a change, he thought his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments too precious to be employ'd in ſatisfying the curioſity of knowing by what means he was ſo
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:60459:217"/>
unexpectedly arrived at ſo compleat a Felicity. The Veſſel under ſail with a favourable gale ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred them as ſecure as Mortals can be on an Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment where the Winds are in a manner Maſter of our Lives as well as Reſolutions. The Happy Lovers loſt not the advantage of the Seaſon to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy one another with as much pleaſure and ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction as proſperous Love is capable of.</p>
                  <p>The Captain of the <hi>Baſſa</hi>'s Guards being arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved at <hi>Tunis,</hi> took Horſe, and ſoon got to <hi>Bardou,</hi> where he found his Maſter walking alone in the Garden, and gave him an account of the departure of <hi>Alexander.</hi> The <hi>Baſſa,</hi> like a man dejected and diſconſolate, having lift up his Eyes and Hands to Heaven, without ſaying a word, withdrew into a Marble Bower in the midſt of the Garden, where he continued all that day, having given his Guards expreſs Orders not to permit any Perſon whatever to come near him; hoping thus to free himſelf from the importunity he fear'd from the <hi>Sultaneſs,</hi> on <hi>Laura</hi>'s account. His Servants and Guards were much ſurprized at theſe Orders, not knowing what might be the cauſe of his diſpleaſure, unleſs it were that <hi>Alexander</hi> was gone.</p>
                  <p>In the Evening arrived at <hi>Bardou</hi> a Spahie, who brought him a Letter, and was followed by another, and he by a third, who all came to ſpeak with him on buſineſs of extream haſte and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; but being acquainted with the Orders he had given, they durſt paſs no further, but reſolved to wait his coming out of the Bower.</p>

of their buſineſs, thought it his Duty to ſtep to the Town, being but three Miles diſtant, to learn what the matter was, and getting preſently on Horſe-back, went directly to the General of the Gallies, being one of them who had diſpatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the <hi>Spahies.</hi> The General ſent him inſtantly back, with ſtrict Order to ſpeak with the <hi>Baſſa,</hi> and tell him, that to oppoſe the deſigns his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies had againſt his Life, his preſence was abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary at <hi>Tunis; Aly,</hi> who apprehended the conſequence of the affair, made no ſcruple (when returned to <hi>Bardou</hi>) to preſent himſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Maſter; who extreamly enraged to ſee his Orders broke firſt by him, would neither hear him, nor receive the Letter he would have delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him from the General of the Gallies. But locking himſelf up, paſt his time till the fourth Prayer, when he took Horſe to return to the Town. By the way he received Letters from ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral, but thinking they came from the <hi>Sultaneſs,</hi> or ſome of her party, he opened not one of them.</p>
                  <p>The General of the Gallies aſtoniſh'd not to ſee him come, after News ſent him what was Plot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting againſt him, reſolved to go in Perſon to ſee what ſtay'd him at <hi>Bardou,</hi> and by the way met him.

Forces he mentioned; and (with Indignation) what, ſays he, will they Aſſault me for love of the <hi>Sultaneſs?</hi> Do not you think, Sir, replyed the General, there is reaſon enough for't? Can you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that a Prince like the <hi>Dey,</hi> your Mortal Enemy (but from the Teeth outwards) can brook the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury you have done him, who loves the <hi>Sultaneſs</hi> his Daughter better than his Life? What in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury, ſaid the <hi>Baſſa?</hi> What injury, reply'd the General? An injury, than which, in my Opinion, a greater could not have been offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. What, anſwers the <hi>Baſſa,</hi> interrupting him, will they diſpute my Power to ſet two of my Slaves at liberty at my pleaſure? No, Sir, ſaid the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, no queſtion is made of your Right or Power in the particular you mention; but the <hi>Sultaneſs</hi> was not your Slave, and unleſs you deſign'd to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage in a new Civil War, not only the Rules of Honour, Juſtice, and Religion, but the Maxims of good Polity, ſhould have prevail'd with you, not to deliver her into the hands of a Chriſtian, than which a greater misfortune cannot befal a Woman of our Religion. The <hi>Baſſa</hi> thought this Diſcourſe ſo extravagant, that he burſt out a laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and gave him no other anſwer, but that he had taken the Alarm too ſoon. The General be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing moved, reply d with ſome heat, you know me too well to think me concern'd at that you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach me with; but when you come to <hi>Tunis,</hi> you ſhall judge if I had not cauſe to take the Alarm. If the <hi>Dey,</hi> anſwer'd the <hi>Baſſa,</hi> deſign a breach with me, he will find a better pretence than you ſpeak of. True it is, I have ſent away <hi>Laura</hi> with <hi>Alexander</hi> the Chriſtian, without the conſent of the <hi>Sultaneſs;</hi> but there were reaſons for it, and ſuch as the the <hi>Sultaneſs</hi> of all Perſons living had moſt
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:60459:219"/>
cauſe to approve. The General of the Gallies did verily believe the <hi>Baſſa</hi> was ſeriouſly bent upon raillery, and willing to keep that as a ſecret which all the World knew; which he took in ill part, and had not ſpoke a word more on that ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, had not the <hi>Baſſa</hi> continued the Diſcourſe. But, Sir, ſaid the General, interrupting him, what pleaſure can you take in endeavouring to conceal from me (one of your beſt Servants and Friends) a buſineſs ſo notorious to all? Every bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy knows <hi>Laura</hi> is in your <hi>Seraglio,</hi> and that the <hi>Sultaneſs</hi> is embarked with <hi>Alexander.</hi> Not to mince the matter, I muſt tell you, the general voice is, that for Love of this Slave, you have rid your hands of the <hi>Sultaneſs</hi> and <hi>Alexander,</hi> and that you deſign to Marry <hi>Laura,</hi> though a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian. But give me leave to tell you, that beſides the novelty of the thing (the like having never happened in this Kingdom) not only the <hi>Dey</hi> and <hi>Divan</hi> will oppoſe it, but your Friends will to their power obſtruct it, and prevent it if they can; and I dare undertake, you will ſcarce find a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of your ſide.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Baſſa</hi> hearing him ſpeak in this manner, thought him diſtracted, and would have uſed him accordingly, but reſtrained by the Friendſhip he had for him; <hi>Laura,</hi> ſays he, whom I ſaw carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a Basket, whom I accompanied to the Port (where they put her aboard a Shallop) whom the Captain of my Guard conducted to the Veſſel in which ſhe was Embarked, and he ſaw under ſail, this <hi>Laura</hi> is in my <hi>Seraglio,</hi> and I am to Marry her Sir, anſwered the General, did I not know you very well, and were fully perſwaded of the good eſteem you are pleaſed to Honour me with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,

I ſhould not know what to think of your Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe; for it cannot be but you know the whole Affair better than any Man. But to end the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute, let us go to your Palace, where you ſhall ſee whether it be <hi>Laura</hi> or the <hi>Sultaneſs</hi> that is there.</p>
                  <p>It was not long ere they arrived at the Palace. The <hi>Baſſa,</hi> who took all that the General had ſaid to be fabulous and vain, would not ſo much as have ſent to the <hi>Seraglio</hi> to know how things ſtood, thinking it foolery to doubt of the <hi>Sultaneſs</hi> being there. However in complaiſance, and by way of raillery, he ordered <hi>Aly</hi> to wait on the <hi>Sultaneſs,</hi> and to Complement her for him, upon the diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure ſhe took for the departure of <hi>Laura.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Captain of the Guard not fancying his Maſter ignorant of what was paſt, took his Order for a meer matter of Addreſs, and a colour only to hide the truth of what he would have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal'd; and approve himſelf able to manage the intrigue, as one who could penetrate into the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires of the Perſon who employ'd him, he went to the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> where he preſently learnt what he formerly knew, that 'twas <hi>Laura</hi> was there; and returning to the <hi>Baſſa,</hi> made him a civil anſwer as from the <hi>Sultaneſs.</hi> This put the General into very great diſorder, and gave the <hi>Baſſa</hi> new occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to laugh, telling him, he did not underſtand the deſign of the <hi>Dey,</hi> in raiſing thoſe Reports to procure him the ill will of his Friends, and hatred of his People, and renew their former broyls with greater violence than ever; but that he ſhould find the means to bring him to Reaſon, and that in the firſt place, he would expoſe the <hi>Sultaneſs</hi> to the view of all the People, and then ſend her home to
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:60459:220"/>
the <hi>Dey,</hi> to let him ſee how unwilling he was to have any Alliance with a man who made it his buſineſs to find occaſions to ruin him.</p>
                  <p>As they were Diſcourſing, they heard a great noiſe on the ſudden in the Palace, followed by Vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies of Muſquet-ſhot, and People crying, to Arms, to Arms. The <hi>Baſſa</hi> went preſently out of his Chamber to ſee what the matter was, and met <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> coming to tell him, that the Palace was inveſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on all ſides, and that an attempt had been made to enter it by force, but that he had beat them back with ten or twelve Souldiers of the Guard, who by good Fortune hapned to be with him. The <hi>Baſſa,</hi> of all men the leaſt ſubject to fear, and of a ready Wit, and admirable judgment in the moſt ſurprizing occaſions, knowing himſelf deſtitute then of Forces to make any reſiſtance, and hearing them threaten to ſet fire on the Palace if the Gate were not opened, order'd they ſhould cry out at the Windows that the Gate ſhould be open d, that thoſe who had begirt the Palace round, and were, for the moſt part, drawn thither with hopes of Plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, might run all to the Gate, and give him op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to make his eſcape another way.</p>
                  <p>The Stratagem took according to his deſire, and he made his eſcape by a private way from his Enemies, who had ſhewed him no Mercy had he fallen into their hands. But he, with the General of the Gallies, and Captain of the Guard, got ſafe to the Mountains, Inhabited by the <hi>Moors,</hi> who had great love for him. He no ſooner gave them notice of the need he had of their help, but they came to him that Night, ſo that by break of day he found himſelf at the head of 8000 Men, Arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſome with Muſquets, ſome with Pikes, both e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually uſeful to them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="85" facs="tcp:60459:220"/>Poor <hi>Laura</hi> was alone, abandoned to the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of this Popular Torrent, who having pillaged in a moment that Rich and Sumptuous Palace, without reſpect to the place or the Sex, entred the <hi>Seraglio</hi> by order from the <hi>Dey,</hi> and took out thence the unfortunate Slave, leaving the reſt expoſed to the will of the Rabble. It was <hi>Laura</hi>'s good For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, that he who had the Commiſſion to take her, was a Perſon of great honeſty and worth, a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Friend of the <hi>Baſſa,</hi> and one who expreſs'd as much reſpect for her as ſhe could wiſh in ſuch a Conjuncture. She was carried to the Caſtle, where ſhe was committed to the ſame Officer's Cuſtody, being a Secretary, and generally eſteemed by all the <hi>Divan.</hi> And being the only Perſon could ſpeak to her without danger of being heard, he confidently told her the firſt time he ſaw her, that the <hi>Baſſa,</hi> whoſe Conduct till then appeared admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, had committed a fact no leſs difficult to be repaired, than generally condemn'd by the beſt of his Friends, but that he feared the greateſt ſmart would be hers. The poor Slave ſufficiently A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larm'd by ſeeing her ſelf forced out of the <hi>Baſſa</hi>'s <hi>Seraglio,</hi> and made the <hi>Dey</hi>'s Priſoner, was fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned much more by the Diſcourſe of this <hi>Turk,</hi> who appeared to her a very credible Perſon; ſhe pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him for Heavens ſake to tell her what the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was, what fault the <hi>Baſſa</hi> had committed, and how ſhe was concern'd in it, that ſhe muſt be thus handled? If you are ignorant of the paſſages this day, anſwered the Secretary, I will let you know them.</p>
                  <p>I believe, continues he, that you know <hi>Chabania,</hi> or at leaſt have heard talk of her, all the World is convinced of the Malignity of her Nature, and
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:60459:221"/>
illneſs of Diſpoſition: But to the buſineſs in hand; that which ſhe affirms, is grounded on Proofs ſo pregnant, and Reaſons ſo clear, that her Malice hath compaſſed the effect ſhe deſired. Whether ſhe was jealous of you, or in diſguſt with the <hi>Baſſa,</hi> I know not, but ſhe is the cauſe of the diſorder you have ſeen; which, if not remedied, may prove the ruin of the Kingdom: The <hi>Dey</hi> was at <hi>Cheſs</hi> when word was brought him, that a Lady from the <hi>Baſſa's Seraglio</hi> deſired to ſpeak with him on buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of great importance. Inſtantly he quitted his Game, and retiring into a Chamber to give the Woman Audience, he ſees <hi>Chabania</hi> enter, attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with her <hi>Eunuchs</hi> who Uſher'd her, who falling before him on her knees, ſpake to this purpoſe. <hi>Sir, I bring you News, which doubtleſs will trouble you. But if I deſerve Death for not being able to endure an injury done to your Royal Blood, and the whole Nation, without giving you Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſement, I am content to ſuffer for it, having the ſatisfaction to ſee you. Revenge the wrong has been done you, which is, that your Daughter is gone, that ſhe is delivered over into the hands of that Chriſtian who ſailed away this Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and that a pitiful Slave is to ſucceed in her place, to the infinite diſhonour of your High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and the Nation. Take your Revenge of the Author of this diſorder, and execute, that Juſtice which you ought againſt ſo cruel an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, acted to the diſhonoar of God, the inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of your Blood, and diſhonour of your Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.</hi> Scarce had ſhe made an end, but the <hi>Dey</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed with Anger, and extreamly enraged, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in thoſe who had waited in the Anti-chamber, and ſcarce able to ſpeak for the Paſſion he was in, made <hi>Chabania</hi> repeat before them all that ſhe had
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:60459:221"/>
ſaid to him. It unhappily fell out that all who were there, were Enemies to the <hi>Baſſa,</hi> and inſtead of appeaſing the <hi>Dey,</hi> took the preſent occaſion to animate and encourage him to get ſatisfaction for ſo cruel an outrage. Women and <hi>Eunuchs</hi> were ſent from the <hi>Dey</hi> to the <hi>Baſſa</hi>'s <hi>Seraglio,</hi> on purpoſe to know the truth and particulars of this Affair, who made their report, that the <hi>Sultaneſs</hi> was not there, that no body knew what was become of her, and that you only were able to give us any news of her. A Meſſenger was preſently diſpatched to <hi>Gouletta,</hi> to enquire at the Caſtle, if there were not a Woman in the Chriſtian Veſſel that ſail'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way this Morning; the anſwer he gave was, that the Veſſel was ſail'd away without being ſearch'd, and that the <hi>Baſſa</hi> had ſent order to that purpoſe by the Captain of his Guards, who accompanied the Chriſtian aboard the Ship. Theſe Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ſo clear and apparent, did but too much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm what <hi>Chabania</hi> had ſaid. Hereupon divers Counſels were held; and the Aſſembly conſiſting of Perſons ill-affected to the <hi>Baſſa,</hi> or at leaſt too Zealous for the <hi>Dey,</hi> the Reſult was, that Revenge ſhould be taken. I cannot conceive how it was poſſible the <hi>Baſſa</hi> had no news what paſt, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port having been preſently noiſed over the Town. It was deſigned he ſhould be ſurprized at <hi>Bardou,</hi> where it was believed he would have lain <hi>this Night.</hi> But News being brought, that he was on his way hither, the <hi>Dey</hi>'s <hi>Aga</hi> had Order, if deny'd en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance, to ſet upon the Palace, and ſeize his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon living or dead. And I at the ſame time was to go to the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> and to carry you away: They miſs'd of him, and it was well for you he eſcaped; for had he been taken, both he and you had been by this time dead. But having ſo luckily made
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:60459:222"/>
his eſcape, and being Maſter of the Militia and <hi>Moors</hi> of the Kingdom, he may become for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable to the <hi>Dey,</hi> and be in a capacity to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver you from danger.</p>
                  <p>The unfortunate <hi>Laura,</hi> too much acquainted with the unkindneſs of her Stars, did nothing but ſigh and groan at the apprehenſions of the new ſtorms that threatned her. She knew better than any, the little reaſon they had to charge the <hi>Baſſa</hi> with the flight of the <hi>Sultaneſs;</hi> and being of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, that by juſtifying the <hi>Baſſa,</hi> her cauſe would appear better before the <hi>Dey;</hi> ſhe told this <hi>Turk,</hi> that her Patron was not, perhaps, ſo guilty as they thought. I know not, continued ſhe, what is become of the <hi>Sultaneſs</hi> ſince ſhe left the <hi>Seraglio</hi> this Morning; but the confidence you have expreſt in me, in the freedom of your ſpeech to me, and your generous carriage obliging me not to be ſo reſerv'd to you, as I would to another; and ſeeing the extremity matters are reduced to, I muſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint you, that if the <hi>Baſſa</hi> ſent away the <hi>Sulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> with the Chriſtian, as is reported, ſhe was very willing to go. And becauſe it is probable you will hardly believe me, without telling you more, I ſhall be forced to relate part of a ſtory which may ſerve at leaſt to excuſe, if not juſtifie the <hi>Baſſa.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>You muſt know, Sir, ſaid ſhe, that the <hi>Sultaneſs</hi> loved <hi>Alexander;</hi> and that ſhe loved him entirely; the occaſion was this: The <hi>Baſſa,</hi> whom every one knows to have had a mighty affection for that Chriſtian, had a longing deſire (whether for Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſement, or to faſten him more cloſely to his Perſon) to ſee him in Love with ſome Lady; and was of Opinion, I might be fit for the purpoſe, if he could but contrive how to bring us together.
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:60459:222"/>
But becauſe I ſtirred not out of the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> and that it would have been a very ſcandalous thing, to ſee a Chriſtian enter a Palace, where none of your Religion but <hi>Eunuchs</hi> have acceſs; he put the ſtranger into the habit of an <hi>Eunuch,</hi> and having prevailed with me to accept of a Viſit from him, brought him to me one Evening. The <hi>Sultaneſs,</hi> already full of good thoughts for the Chriſtian, whom the <hi>Baſſa</hi> had a thouſand times ſpoke to her of, was extreamly glad to hear of the deſign, to bring him to her very Apartment, and with ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry great earneſtneſs prayed me, if poſſible, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure her the pleaſure of ſeeing him. This proved no hard task for me to perform: The <hi>Baſſa,</hi> who ſeldom came to viſit the <hi>Sultaneſs,</hi> ſending him al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt every day diſguiſed like an <hi>Eunuch</hi> into the <hi>Seraglio;</hi> ſo that I had no more to do but provide for the Secrecy of the interview between my Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs and <hi>Alexander.</hi> They had a ſight of each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and if <hi>Alexander</hi> was ſo handſom, as to pleaſe the <hi>Sultaneſs,</hi> you may imagine that ſo Beautiful a Lady could not diſpleaſe him. Their Love in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed day by day to that height, that they ſaw one another very often. The <hi>Baſſa</hi> ſeeing his Chriſtian in Love, and thinking me the object of it, took ſingular pleaſure in it. The <hi>Baſſa</hi> had formerly had ſome kindneſs for me, which cool'd by my reſiſtance; but having one day for Diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſement cauſed <hi>Alexander</hi> to give him an account of the progreſs of his Amour, the fire of his Love ſo long raked up and ſmothered, kindled afreſh in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a flame; and gathering from the ſucceſs of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander</hi>s Addreſs, that I was not inſenſible, as I pretended to him; he renewed his Courtſhip, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingled now and then with reproaches for the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:60459:223"/>
eſteem I had for him in preferring the affection of a Slave before his: I fore-ſaw the danger, but was unwilling to make him ſenſible of his miſtake, to ſave the two Lovers from the inconveniences which would certainly attend the diſcovery. And making my ſelf a Sacrifice to the pleaſure of the <hi>Sultaneſs,</hi> I let him believe I was not inſenſible of the Merit of <hi>Alexander.</hi> The affair thus managed, there followed many pleaſant Adventures and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigues, which for fear of troubling you too much at preſent, I ſhall defer the relation of it to a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Opportunity. The mean time, the <hi>Baſſa</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly preſſed me, and reproached me daily for ſlighting his Paſſion, and at the ſame time favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Chriſtian far leſs worthy of my affection. He left no ſtone unturned to compaſs his Amorous deſigns, inſomuch as at laſt he found the means to have a privat and dumb interview in the dark with his Wife, whom he miſtook for me, and did her all the violence imaginable to be revenged of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſibility I had for him. Having ſatisfied himſelf, he parted with her without knowing her, bleſſing himſelf for the good Fortune of having obtained that which he might have commanded every day. But grieved at laſt for the outrage he thought he had done me, and not knowing how to excuſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to a Miſtreſs extreamly offended, he judg'd no better amends could be made for his fault, than ſetting at Liberty two Lovers, whoſe Paſſion he had ſo unjuſtly injured, after having been not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the promoter, but firſt Author of their Love. He ſent me the News of his Reſolution by a Billet he writ to me, wherein he pleaded in excuſe the great Paſſion he had for me; that to expiate his fault, he would deprive himſelf for ever of the
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:60459:223"/>
ſight of me, and ſend me back with my Love to my Country, being all could be deſired from a generous Rival: And that if I were ſenſible of the pain and regret my abſence would coſt him, I ſhould find him puniſhed beyond his deſert. My joy was not greater than the trouble of the <hi>Sulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> upon receiving this News which put her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an unſpeakable affliction. Her Nights and her Days were wholly ſpent in Tears; ſhe uſed all means poſſible to prevent the misfortune ſhe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended from <hi>Alexander</hi>'s return into <hi>Italy.</hi> I gave her way, chooſing rather to renounce my Liberty, than ſee her die for grief in the condition ſhe was in. But the <hi>Baſſa,</hi> the firmeſt of men in what he reſolves on, not perceiving the reaſon ſhe had to oppoſe a deſign ſhe had more reaſon than he to promote, conſidering the Paſſion ſhe knew he had for me, which muſt needs trouble her, was true to his Reſolution; and knowing there was in the Port a Chriſtian Veſſel ready to Sail for <hi>Italy,</hi> he cauſed it to be ſtaid for our Embarking therein. What a trouble was it to the <hi>Sultaneſs</hi> to ſee the <hi>Baſſa</hi> ſo obſtinate, and us on the point of departing! Never was a Perſon ſo plunged in a Sea of deſpair, never were ſighs ſo lamentable as hers; I was reſolved to entreat the <hi>Baſſa</hi> to put off our departure to another occaſion, that I might gain time to diſpoſe her to grant me the favour; but whether it were for the ſhame to ſee me, or for fear that the ſight of me might melt him into a tenderneſs that might alter the Reſolution he had taken, he appear'd not at the <hi>Seraglio.</hi> The Morning we were to be gone, the deſolate <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taneſs</hi> reſolved to die, or to follow us; ſhe had long ſtudied to contrive a way how to do it: I
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:60459:224"/>
was her Bed-fellow, but neither of us ſlept a wink. <hi>Laura,</hi> ſays ſhe, having conſidered well what ſhe would do, thou knoweſt the affection I ever had for thee, that I have uſed thee more like a Siſter than a Slave. Thou knoweſt my heart, and I need not tell thee I cannot live without <hi>Alexander.</hi> I deſire no acknowledgment of what I have done for thee, (added ſhe, kiſſing me with her face all bath'd in tears) but for pity ſake, forſake me not in the moſt deſperate condition that a Woman, in Love as I am, can be reduced to, but do ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to ſave my Life: had ſhe deſired mine with ſuch melting expreſſions, I could not have denied it her, which ſhe might perceive by the tears I ſhed to accompany hers. Then ſhe told me of an intention ſhe had thought of, whereby to get a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board with us, and that ſhe doubted not of the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, if <hi>Alexander</hi> had the Paſſion he pretended to have for her; and if he had not, ſhe would com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort her ſelf, and find pleaſure in Rage for the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of ſo ingrate a Perſon; that without the knowledge of any one in the <hi>Seraglio</hi> ſhe would be carried to his Lodging, and thence aboard the Veſſel we were to Embark in; and that the <hi>Baſſa</hi> ſending for me to be gone, we might all three get aboard before any Diſcovery could be made of her departure. To give her content, I approved of what ſhe ſaid, but did really apprehend the ſucceſs of this affair, and preſage, I know not how, that I ſhould be the ſufferer. 'Tis a dangerous buſineſs to yield ones ſelf up to the conduct of Lovers, in that which concerns the intereſt of their affections; they are apt to flatter themſelves, to puff themſelves up with hope, and admit of no fear. When the day began to appear in our Chamber, we thought
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:60459:224"/>
it high time to ſet about and take order for what we thought neceſſary for accompliſhing our deſires. We got up, and the <hi>Sultaneſs</hi> having put on a Suit of mine, commanded me to call her one of the <hi>Eunuchs,</hi> who was Purveyor for <hi>Alexander,</hi> and ready to Sacrifice his Life for the Service of the <hi>Sultaneſs;</hi> ſhe ſent him for the basket wherein he uſed to carry the Proviſion, and placing her ſelf in it, wrapt up in my <hi>Barnus,</hi> commanded him to carry her to <hi>Alexander</hi>'s Lodging. I ſaw her go away in this manner, waiting with fear and impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience enough to hear the ſucceſs of this contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of the <hi>Sultaneſs,</hi> and expecting every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Orders from the <hi>Baſſa</hi> for my going away. At laſt, the time of Embarking being over, and the <hi>Sultaneſs</hi> not returned, I was deſirous to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed how matters paſt, and underſtood with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoniſhment and diſpleaſure enough, that <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> was gone, and that the <hi>Baſſa,</hi> having brought him to the Port, returned for <hi>Bardou.</hi> Then it was, Sir, I felt the ſtroke of my ill Fortune, in loſing, not only the hope of returning to my Country, which might have given me ſome com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, but of ever ſeeing the <hi>Sultaneſs,</hi> the Perſon of the World I had moſt kindneſs for, and one who ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred my Captivity pleaſing. I could not doubt but her flight would be laid to my charge; but the conſideration of a Life ſo unhappy as mine, had produced in me ſo clear reſolutions for death, that, had you taken notice at your arrival, you could not obſerve any trouble in my countenance. And in good earneſt the loſs of my dear <hi>Sultaneſs</hi> afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me ſo, that the appearance of death could not have done more. They asked me oftentimes what was become of her? the anſwer I made, was,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:60459:225"/>
that I knew not: But having been long taken for her Confident, I was ſhrewdly ſuſpected. As for the reſt of her Servants, you might have read in their countenances, the trouble of their minds.</p>
                  <p>This is that, Sir, I had to ſay to you of the <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taneſs;</hi> and if you think this Story may be of uſe to the <hi>Baſſa,</hi> and conduce to the procuring peace between him and the <hi>Dey,</hi> I ſhould be very glad you would relate it to him, though I may appear guilty of having committed a crime againſt the one and the other But they have prudence enough to be ſenſible of the condition of a poor Slave, whoſe happineſs conſiſted in her complaiſance to a Miſtreſs, who loved her ſo well as to make her a confident in affairs of this conſequence. The Turk made anſwer, that the <hi>Baſſa</hi> had ſo much kindneſs for her, and ſo little for the <hi>Sultaneſs,</hi> that he would eaſily pardon the Treaſon ſhe was guilty of; and as for the <hi>Dey,</hi> he could not be much of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended with her, for having done his Daughter ſo eminent a ſervice, in aſſiſting her in a piece of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithfulneſs to a Husband who (the <hi>Dey</hi> knows) had not any Love for her: and that he would make uſe of the particulars of this Story to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile them; that he would manage this buſineſs with ſome Friends of the <hi>Divan,</hi> and particularly with the <hi>Aga,</hi> the <hi>Deys</hi> Favourite, who had great influence over him, and though a Renegade, loved the Chriſtians very well, and might do her ſome ſervice. To theſe expreſſions he added a thouſand aſſurances on his part, and civilities enough to oblige her extreamly. This done, he withdrew, to avoid the ſuſpicion her Guard might have of a longer diſcourſe, it being already very late, but
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:60459:225"/>
promiſed to ſee her again on the morrow, and bring her News of all that paſt.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Baſſa</hi> being now at the Head of ſo many <hi>Moors,</hi> thought himſelf ſtrong enough to take the Field, and as ſoon as it was day, marched down towards the Town, to favour the retreat of his Friends, and of the Souldiers who came flocking in to him; ſo that before noon he had an Army of <hi>Moors</hi> and <hi>Turks</hi> above ten thouſand ſtrong. The <hi>Dey</hi> uſed all diligence poſſible to arm his people, but found himſelf not ſtrong enough that day to encounter the <hi>Baſſa,</hi> whoſe Arms were already grown terrible to his Enemies, who from his juſt indignation againſt them apprehended a Siege. But his quarrel being chiefly to the <hi>Dey,</hi> and want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Cannon to attack him in the Caſtle he was in, the <hi>Baſſa</hi> was forced to wait the arrival of the Artillery he had ſent for to the Port whereof he was Maſter.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time, having aſſembled the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal of his Friends, to make his complaint to them of the unjuſt proceedings of the <hi>Dey,</hi> and to demand their advice, he was not a little amazed to hear them all maintain, as the General of the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leys; that it was his Wife was gone away with the Chriſtian; and that <hi>Laura</hi> ſtaid in the <hi>Seraglio;</hi> and that the <hi>Dey</hi> had reaſon enough for what he had done, in the belief he was in of the <hi>Baſſa</hi>'s intentions to make away his Daughter. The <hi>Baſſa,</hi> who ſtill fancied that they were abuſed, would not vouchſafe to contradict them, but call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Captain of his Guards, asked him before them, if he had not the day before ſpoken with the <hi>Sultaneſs.</hi> Poor <hi>Aly</hi> ſhivering for fear, fell down at his feet with his face to the ground, and
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:60459:226"/>

He was not much troubled at the miſtake he had been guilty of, and thought that in matters of Love, a Miſtreſs of at leaſt as good value as a Wife. He never ſuſpected any treachery in the Caſe, but was will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to know what reaſon could have reduced her to diſguiſe her ſelf in that manner, and go along with <hi>Alexander;</hi> yet he could not but think <hi>Laura</hi> of the Plot, but thought himſelf revenged of her, and her ſufficiently puniſhed, in having loſt at once her Lover, and the occaſion of her liberty, to pleaſure a Miſtreſs, who might become a Rival. He longed extreamly to ſee her, to know the whole buſineſs; and Love adding new flames to this curioſity, made him ſo impatient of delay, that how dangerous ſoever the enterprize might have been, he would have gone that very day to <hi>Tunis,</hi> if his preſence with the Army had not been abſolutely neceſſary, to receive thoſe who every moment came over to his party.

                  <p>By that time he had written this Billet, the night was far gone; yet for more ſurety he would not let the <hi>Moor</hi> go till three or four a Clock in the Morning. The Walls of <hi>Tunis</hi> are very low, and in ſome places eaſie to get over. True it is, they were then very well guarded; but the bearer of the Billet being known to belong to the <hi>Deys</hi> Secretary, there was no danger of his being ſtaid; and accordingly he found his paſſage free as he could wiſh.</p>
                  <p>The generous <hi>Aſſen</hi> had been that Evening to viſit his fair Priſoner according to promiſe, and given her an account how matters ſtood, with ſome hopes of accommodation between parties at difference; for that it was clear by the confeſſion of the <hi>Eunuch</hi> who had carried the <hi>Sultaneſs</hi> in the Basket, that if the <hi>Baſſa</hi> had a hand in ſending away the <hi>Sultaneſs,</hi> ſhe had contributed not a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle to her enlargement, out of a criminal paſſion ſhe had for <hi>Alexander,</hi> by going to ſee him at his Lodging. <hi>Laura</hi> well pleaſed with this News, could not ſufficiently thank <hi>Aſſen</hi> for the obliging care he had of her. He had ſent ſo many ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſorts of excellent refreſhments, that ſhe found her ſelf better uſed in the Priſon, than in the <hi>Baſſa's
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:60459:227"/>
Seraglio;</hi> ſhe knew not what to attribute ſo much goodneſs and complaiſance to, and was a little troubled, out of an apprehenſion ſhe had there might be ſome love in the caſe; for the <hi>Turk</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared ſo civil, ſo punctual, and ſo full of kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, above the ordinary rate of thoſe of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, that ſhe had cauſe to think him rather a Lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of her, than a meer Friend of the <hi>Baſſa's;</hi> yet had he not in a ſyllable tranſgreſſed the reſpect that was due to her, which pleaſed her the more, that ſhe had no cauſe on that account to be angry with a Man who had done her ſo many good Offices. And the truth is, he acted only out of a principle of generoſity, having been five or ſix years a Slave in <hi>Italy</hi> to a Patron who had uſed him very well; and therefore being of a generous nature, he held himſelf obliged to do the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans good offices, as having for them a more than ordinary Love and Eſteem.</p>
                  <p>As <hi>Laura</hi> was complaining of her ill Fortune, which threw her out of one miſchance into another, he pray'd her to tell him how ſhe was made a Slave. <hi>Laura</hi> was ſo much obliged to him, that the trouble ſhe might expect in her ſelf, upon a freſh relation of her misfortunes, could not hinder her from giving him that ſmall ſatisfaction, in ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment of the many ſervices he had done her; ſo that having aſſured him there was nothing pleaſant in the ſtory of her life, yet to let him know the firſt riſe of her misfortunes, ſhe begun in this manner.</p>

                        <p>Sir, I was born at <hi>Genoa,</hi> and of one of the beſt Families of that Republick, but you ſhall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe me, if I conceal the name: I will ſave my Family that ſhame, ſince my misfortunes can do it

no credit. I was born in a proſperous and flouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Eſtate, and my Parents having no other Child, I was bred With that care and expence I may rather call profuſe than great. It was my misfortune that my Mother died when I was but <hi>12</hi> years old, and that my Father, though aged, married a young Lady more conſiderable for Birth than Eſtate; but my Father had ſufficient to ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the ambition or pride of a Woman of quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. But theſe were not the Vanities my Mother-in-law was ſubject to, it was Love had the Aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent over her. My Father was old, ſhe was young and handſom, and he had cauſe to be jealous of her. He let her ſtir but very rarely out of her Lodging, and never but in his company, and then only to Church, or to make a viſit to a Friend or Relation. But who can reſiſt his fate? My Mother-in-law, little pleaſed with the ſevere hand my Father held over her, found her inclination to be unfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to him, increaſe more and more; nothing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vokes deſire more than reſtraint, and difficulties and ſtraits are Siſters of invention; ſhe made uſe of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral to carry on ſome little intrigues in the Town, but all to no purpoſe; my Father, an old Maſter in Gallantry, was ſo cunning and miſtruſtful, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing could eſcape him. So that the kind Lady deſparing of relief from abroad, was willing to try if ſhe could find at home any means to ſatisfie her inclinations. She caſt her eyes on a Man, of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition ſo mean, I dare not for her reputation let you know what it was, though otherwiſe very handſom, honeſt, and till then very faithful to my Father, who had more truſt in him, than in any of his Domeſticks: this acquaintance and famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arity ſo diſhonourable for a Lady of her quality,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:60459:228"/>
laſted for ſome time without being diſcovered, till at laſt by ill fortune for them and for me, having laid me down to ſleep on a bed of repoſe in my Mother-in-laws chamber, I was an eye-witneſs of their Infamy: they were not aware of me, my Maid having by chance covered me with a piece of Tapeſtry, laid uſually on the bed. I ſaw them, and they me, with what ſurprize you may imagine. I was then <hi>14</hi> or <hi>15</hi> years old. Was he not a Slave, ſays the <hi>Turk?</hi> interrupting, with a tone full of joy and ſurprize. Yes, Sir, anſwer'd <hi>Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra</hi> (aſtoniſht at the Queſtion, which made her look earneſtly on him) he was a Slave, and of <hi>Turky.</hi> Ah Madam, cries the other, as ſoon as ſhe had ſaid ſo, is it poſſible you ſhould not know <hi>Aſſen?</hi> and that you ſhould be Madam <hi>Elinor?</hi> At this <hi>Laura</hi> was mute for ſome time, and then recollect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her ſelf, Oh Heavens! is it you, my poor <hi>Aſſen,</hi> ſays ſhe? By what good fortune have I met you here, and fallen in your hands? By the beſt fortune in the world both for you and me, ſays the <hi>Turk,</hi> raviſhed with joy to find himſelf in a condition to ſerve her, and being under the obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations I am to you, I ſhould be the moſt ingrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of men, if I imploy not my ſelf in your ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. I know you may accuſe me on the account of your Mother-in-law, but what could a poor ſlave have done, tempted by the charms of a fair Lady, who offered him Money and Liberty when he pleaſed? You will confeſs, men are gain'd by leſs matters, and that if I committed a Crime in doing as I did, after the Confidence ſo good a Maſter as your Father repoſed in me, and the bounty he ſhewed me, yet it is pardonable; at leaſt I believe I have made ſome amends for my

fault, in ſaving your Lives, which your Mother would have robbed both you and him of by poyſon. But I had that influence over her Paſſion, that I diverted her from it.

                  <p>Your ſight of us, as you ſaid, ſurpriz'd ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly both the one and the other; and in that deſperate Paſſion your Mother-in-Law was then in, I know not what ſhe would have done to have been rid of you. But, as I told you, I op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed her, and made her underſtand, that the courſe ſhe propoſed, would certainly plunge us into irreparable Miſchiefs, and doubtleſs, coſt us both our Lives. That it were better to endeavour to gain you by fair means, in hopes that being ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good natur'd, you would not purſue our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, by making your Father acquainted with that which would certainly be the cauſe of his Death, and bring him to his Grave. You cannot but remember I went alone with you out of the Chamber to perſwade you. And that I told you, it concern'd the Honour of your Houſe to keep the matter private, with ſeveral other reaſons, with which you expreſs'd your ſelf convinced. At laſt, you promiſed me not to make any more noiſe of it, if your Mother-in-Law would, for the future, keep within the bounds of her Duty. I made a relation of all this to her, expecting that the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of your diſcretion, ſo well known in the Family, would have paſt for current Security, for your keeping your word. But it could not ſecure her from ſtrange inquietude and trouble of Mind. She could not ſee you without ſhame, nor come
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:60459:229"/>
near your Father without trembling. She buzz'd inſtantly in my Ears, that there was a neceſſity of making you both a Sacrifice to her Repoſe; and that till then ſhe could not expect any Pleaſure in her Life. She told me, I muſt help her to effect the deſign, or expect to be the firſt that ſhould feel the weight of her wrath. I endeavoured the beſt I could to reduce her to Reaſon, but for ſome time ſhe would not hear any. At laſt, her ill humour deſired only the ſatisfaction of your being put out of your Lodging, and was content to find out ſeveral pretences to perſwade your Father to put you into a Nunnery, or at leaſt out of his Houſe. Notwithſtanding all the Arts of her Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaiſance and Cunning, ſhe found it no eaſie mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to bring this about; but for the quiet of the Houſe, it was neceſſary to pleaſe her, and place you under Penſion in a Nunnery. Shortly after, whether it were that you had diſcovered the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or that ſhe fear'd you had done ſo, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that ſhe was willing to be rid of me, by this Stratagem ſhe came one Night to my Chamber, while your Father was aſleep, and with a fright in her looks told me, I was undone, that my Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter knew all, and that I had no more but that Night for to ſave my ſelf. Whereupon ſhe gave me Money, and ſeeing me reſolved to be gone, bid me her laſt farewell. I kept, as you remember, the Keys of the Houſe, and ſo got eaſily out. I had, for a Diſguiſe, taken a black Suit of your Fathers, and as ſoon as it was day, and the Port open, I hired a Felucca, which carried me to <hi>Legorne,</hi> where I lay private three days, ſtaying for a Veſſel of the Great Dukes, which was to carry a Preſent to <hi>Mahomet Baſſa,</hi> my Ancient
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:60459:230"/>
Friend, who made uſe of his Intereſt with the <hi>Dey</hi> to reſtore me my Eſtate, which ſince I was a Slave, had been Confiſcated, upon a belief I was dead. But having fail'd of his deſire, he procured me in recompence, the Secretaries place, which is no great matter here. This, Madam, is the account of my Life ſince I left <hi>Italy.</hi> You may oblige me in acquainting me with yours, which I could not come to the knowledge of, having never heard ſince from <hi>Genoa.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That which remains to be told you, ſays <hi>Elinor</hi> (whom we will yet call <hi>Laura</hi>) is a ſtory full of troubles and misfortunes; the more difficult for me to relate, that a Perſon of Quality cannot but be aſhamed of them. But I will be free with you.</p>
                  <p>Having ſpent two Years in the Covent I was placed in, my Father moved with many tears, took me home; where for the time I ſtayed there, I was under continual Perſecution from my Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-in-law; who having got the Aſcendent over the good Man, made him believe what ſhe pleaſed. She had new deſigns in her Head, which you may believe was the cauſe of the fear ſhe put you in: for my Father never had the leaſt knowledge of your familiarity, and was much troubled at your running away, declaring he had loſt in you the beſt Servant he had. He had deſigned to have ſet you at Liberty, which was the reaſon he ſent not after you, as he might have done. I was by this time become ſomewhat clear ſighted, and what I knew of my Mother-in-law, made me ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect every thing ſhe did: I watched her narrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and in few days diſcovered a new Gallant. You may believe, that after the miſchiefs ſhe had
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:60459:230"/>
done me, I fail'd not to do her all the ill Offices in my power: it is the nature of our Sex never to Pardon. But beſides the pleaſure of Revenge, I was engaged in Honour againſt her. This raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a War between us more violent than ever, and my Father had trouble enough to content us both. At firſt ſhe thought her ſelf hard enough for me, having once already turn'd me out of the Houſe, and afterwards ſent you packing; and putting on a bold face, fear'd nothing, as knowing I would not accuſe her of any thing, but her impudence could bring her off, my Evidence being gone. But when ſhe perceived by my obſtructing her new practices, rallying her on all occaſions, and other cutting effects of my reſentment, that I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood her Secrets, ſhe ſpared nothing that Rage and Fury could ſuggeſt to her againſt me: At laſt, ſhe fell heavy upon me with my Father; and having not prevailed with him to return me into the Monaſtery, forced him to turn me again out of his Houſe, and place me with his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations; where I paſſed ſix Months with one, and ſix Months with another, to the great diſpleaſure of the Family. Till at laſt a Grandee of <hi>Spain,</hi> an old Friend of my Fathers, having been created Viceroy of <hi>Naples,</hi> and paſſing by <hi>Genoa</hi> to go and take Poſſeſſion of his Government, my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther intreated him to take me along with him, which he readily did. The Viceroy and his Lady received and entertained me, not only as the Daughter of their intimate Friend, but as their own, and honoured me with ſuch expreſſions of Civility and Bounty, that I thought my ſelf too happy in being of their Train. And the truth is, I was not deceived; theſe beginnings of kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:60459:231"/>
growing every day to greater perfection, eſpecially on the part of the Viceroy's Lady, who appeared not able to live a moment without me. She had been a great Beauty, and was not then unhandſome, though not very young. She kept nothing from me, but imparted to me her moſt private thoughts, and made me the Confident of her deareſt affections. This laſted as long as I was diſintereſs'd, but there is no truſting one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother of our Sex, eſpecially in matters of Love. I was reputed not unhandſome, and having a full Purſe at command, I lived at that Court with Splendor enough. It was preſently known, I was not the moſt inconſiderable of <hi>Genoa,</hi> and this advantage ſet off with a little Beauty, raiſed ſo great a number of Pretenders to me, that I could not paſs a day without treats and addreſſes of Love. The Court of <hi>Naples</hi> hath always paſs'd for the moſt Gallant of <hi>Italy,</hi> by reaſon of the multitude of Perſons of Quality in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, but was never ſo pleaſant as then. I was ſo young that I knew not what Love was, and was not concerned to make haſte to learn it, but made the Cares and Sighs of thoſe in Love, my ſport and divertiſement. But Love will in time be revenged, and make ſport of us that make ſport of him. I had not yet ſeen the man who had the ſecret to affect my heart, no not one who could pleaſe, though that Court had of all ſorts, and ſome very handſome. The Son of the Viceroy, being a young Lord very well accompliſhed, and not a little concerned for me, did but give me trouble. But as I hinted before, I pay'd dear for that indifference and thoſe ſlights I gloried ſo much in. Five or ſix months after our arrival at <hi>Naples,</hi> there appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:60459:231"/>
at Court a young Gentleman, whom Love ſeems to have raiſed up for my ruin. It was the Marqueſs <hi>Hippolito</hi> of the Houſe of <hi>Accelyn,</hi> equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſiderable for his good parts as his Birth; a Youth whoſe outſide was taking enough to charm at firſt ſight, but as traiterous and wicked within, as he was outwardly handſome and well accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed. When you have heard out my ſtory, you will ſay I ſpeak with too much moderation. It is hard to hate what we have been once truly in Love with. In ſpite of that unpardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able outrage he did me, I find that if I ſaw him, and had it in my power to take my revenge of him by death, which he hath but too well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, my reſentment would give place to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination I had for him. He was newly come from <hi>France,</hi> and had got the Court-air, ſo pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar and natural to thoſe of quality of that Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. I was extreamly pleaſed to ſee him, and look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon him with delight, the firſt time he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, at Court; and was ſenſible of it, though with ſhame and anger at my ſelf. From thence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth he was conſtantly in my thoughts, though very troubleſome to me. I was diſpleaſed with my ſelf for it, and would upon any terms have put him out of my mind, but the more I endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it, the more I found him ſettled there. I ſaw him ſeveral times after, and to end the War within me would fain have perſwaded my ſelf, it was not for my honour to entertain ſuch thoughts of that Gentleman; but I found in the end my ingenuity deceived me. That which contributed moſt to my ruin, that both by his looks and his actions he ſeemed to prefer me before all the Ladies of the Court, and though he did not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:60459:232"/>
ſo much, yet I could obſerve he had more than an ordinary reſpect for me, and would now and then ſay to my ſelf ſome things I fancied he might and would have ſaid to me. At laſt I made my ſelf of his Party, and blaming my paſt coyneſs, I thought it very allowable and juſt, to have ſome eſteem for a man who merited it from all the World: Having once entertained this thought, and convinced of it as reaſonable, my paſſion and Love finding my heart already more than half open, preſs'd in and abſolutely took it. The <hi>Viceroy</hi>'s Lady, who often diverted her ſelf in en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaining me with all the Intrigues of the Court, having one day told me ſeveral Stories, asked me if I knew the Marqueſs <hi>Hippolito</hi>'s Miſtreſs, for that, for ſome days paſt, ſhe obſerved him very ſolitary and out of humour, which ſhe took for an effect of ſome inclination. Had ſhe look'd upon me when ſhe asked me the queſtion, ſhe might have read in my countenance how much I was concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; for I chang'd colour three or four times. But being upon the Tarraſs of the Palace on the Country ſide, ſhe was looking that way, and took no notice of me; ſo that having time to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover my ſelf, I anſwered with an affected cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that he was a dull young fellow, and I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved incapable of Love: and thereupon out of Jealouſie her queſtion had raiſed in me, I made a deſcription of him as really unlike him, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the thoughts I had of him. The Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roy's Lady fell a laughing, and having looked upon me ſo, as ſhe believed, would have put me out of countenance; is it poſſible, ſays ſhe, that you ſhould think ſo of a man whom all the other Ladies eſteem the handſomeſt of the Court? If I
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:60459:232"/>
were not very well perſwaded of your indifference for all men, I ſhould believe of you quite contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to what you ſay. But look to your ſelf, for ſooner or later you ſhall be met with, and your inſenſible heart ſhall have her turn as well as others. As for me, I confeſs, were I as you, that young Gentleman would pleaſe me, and I would not have you ſlight him: Think of it, he is a Perſon of merit and worth, and wants nothing of what may juſtly deſerve Love from a fair Lady as you are. Who would not have believed but ſhe ſpoke in good earneſt? Who could have miſtruſted her after ſo many kindneſſes and favours ſhe daily laid out on me? I know not whether I was to blame, but muſt confeſs I yielded my ſelf to be taken, and was ready to unſay in her pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence all that I had ſpoken againſt the Marqueſs <hi>Hippolito,</hi> and to acknowledge I had prevented her in the thoughts ſhe had been pleaſed to inſpire into me of him, but my modeſty reſtrained me. I thought my ſelf concerned in honour, to expect an Addreſs from him, before I would confeſs my ſelf taken. I could never diſcover perfectly this Ladies deſign, but as far as I can gueſs by the conſequence, ſhe queſtion'd me of pure jealouſie, endeavouring to diſcover whether I had any affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for the Marqueſs. She had often ſeen us talk together; judging by her thoughts of him, that it it was hard enough for a Lady to be acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a Gentleman of ſo many charming Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, without loving him; ſhe had doubtleſs ſome apprehenſion I had on his account ceas d to be inſenſible. But finding by what I ſaid, that I continued indifferent, her jealouſie giving place to Love-policy, ſhe deſired to ſettle ſome friendſhip
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:60459:233"/>
between him and me, to ſerve her for a pretence to ſee him as oft as ſhe deſired. At leaſt I am of opinion theſe were the reaſons obliged her to ſpeak of me as ſhe did, and to tell me, if ever I meant to love, I could not make a better choice. I ſtood out ſtifly to the end, telling her, my Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty was ſo precious, that I would not part with it for any conſideration in the World, if the keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing depended wholly on me: But becauſe thoſe of my condition were not born to enjoy it all their Life; whatever I endured, I would be guided by my Friends, and abſolutely obey their pleaſure who had the right to diſpoſe of me. Hereupon ſhe embraced me, and ſaid, all the Maids of the World would be wiſe, were they of my humour, and followed my example. In the mean time, ſince I was reſolved not to ſlight the Counſel of Friends, it was her advice I ſhould admit the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs <hi>Hippolito</hi> to ſee me ſometimes. But Madam, ſaid I, interrupting her, hath he deſired leave to do it, and is it at his requeſt you make me the motion? She anſwered, ſaying, that I need not trouble my ſelf for that, but might believe this overture came not altogether from her; and that the Marqueſs had found me out as well as others. You may imagine what a pleaſure ſhe did me, in telling me this, who deſired nothing more than the love of that Gentleman.</p>
                  <p>This diſcourſe being over, we parted extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly miſtaken in our thoughts of one another. She imagin'd I was ſtill the ſame, and altogether in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible of love; and I thought ſhe had ſpoken as a Friend, and really deſired to ſee me in love with the Marqueſs: We began to have the young Lords Company, after the particular kindneſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:60459:233"/>
him and <hi>Don Alphonſe,</hi> Son to the Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roy, gave him free entrance where he pleaſed; and the Viceroy having no ſmall eſteem for the Marqueſs, was not only glad to ſee him at Court, but ingaged him by his Civilities to come to him oftner. I ſhall forbear mentioning what the Lady contributed on her part; but you may believe if very probable, that having the kindneſs ſhe had for him, ſhe omitted nothing in her power to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther theſe Viſits. At firſt he was altogether for me, at leaſt in appearance; for ſeveral days he wanted nothing of diligence or complaiſance to pleaſe me. Where-ever <hi>I</hi> went he ſtill waited up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me, approved all that <hi>I</hi> ſaid, and took my part on all occaſions. In a word, he practiſed all that may be done, for gaining a Miſtreſs; and was preſently looked upon in Court as a new Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of mine Many of my Friends congratula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted my Conqueſt, and <hi>I</hi> could not but laugh at them. Not but that I believed it, being eaſily perſwaded to credit what I ſo much deſired, but that I was afraid to believe it ſo ſoon, and was unwilling it ſhould be known, to avoid the ſhame that might attend a miſtake. He had not as then ſpoke to me of Love; and the leaſt <hi>I</hi> could do, was to expect he ſhould declare himſelf. A Lover of ſo much Wit as the Marqueſs, could not fail of finding an occaſion. But <hi>I</hi> know not whether for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune befriended him ſo ill, as not to afford him one. However, 'tis certain he never took any to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover his Paſſion by Speech: All that <hi>I</hi> knew of it, was from his looks and his ſighs, which perhaps my kindneſs interpreted too favourably. Men being now accuſtomed to a general Gallantry, that in ſhew and appearance, both their words and their
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:60459:234"/>
actions ſpeak altogether of Love. Theſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing bloſſoms of an apparent affection, were all blaſted on the ſudden. <hi>I</hi> was ſurpriz'd at it to aſtoniſhment, to ſee him ſo far advanced to make ſo ſudden a ſtop, at a time <hi>I</hi> leaſt expected it, and prepared my ſelf to give occaſion to diſcover his affection, which <hi>I</hi> fear'd his reſpect for me, or his fear to diſpleaſe me, had hindred from doing. <hi>I</hi> could not imagine the cauſe of ſo ſudden a change; for three whole days he abſented from the Court, and when he appeared there, he looked like a man ſo cold, ſo altered, as if he durſt not caſt an eye upon me, whereas before he was jovial and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaiſant, and his eye never off me, you cannot eaſily imagine how terribly this vext me. <hi>I</hi> was upon the point of asking him the reaſon, and had certainly done it, but that <hi>I</hi> was over-rul'd by a little haughtineſs and pride, which making me look on his inconſtant proceeding, as an effect of manifeſt Treachery, inſpired me with ſcorn and averſion againſt him; which however <hi>I</hi> ſmarted for in the end: for two whole days <hi>I</hi> did nothing but weep and complain of Love and my own wickedneſs. The Viceroy's Lady obſerving me ſad and dejected, though <hi>I</hi> did all in my power to hide part of my trouble, asked me what <hi>I</hi> did ail, which probably ſhe knew but too well, but was willing to have the pleaſure of hearing what <hi>I</hi> would ſay, <hi>I,</hi> who till then had not the leaſt reaſon to diſtruſt her, made no ſcruple of telling her in plain terms the cauſe of my grief, and told her, ſhe had more than any contributed thereto. This made her bluſh, and comprehending on the ſudden what <hi>I</hi> meant, but thinking without doubt <hi>I</hi> had diſcovered her ſecret. But <hi>I</hi> fell unhappily
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:60459:234"/>
to explaining my ſelf, and ſeriouſly confeſs'd to her, that what ſhe had ſaid to me of the Marqueſs <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polito,</hi> had produced in me ſome diſpoſition of kindneſs for him, which coſt me then very dear, having been very confident ſhe would not have deceived me, but that the Marqueſs had now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived us both. <hi>I</hi> muſt confeſs, ſays the Traytreſs, <hi>I</hi> was willing to conceal from you the inconſtancy and change of a fooliſh young flaſh, and did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign not to ſpeak to you any more of him, not thinking you could be much concerned for him after what <hi>I</hi> had heard you ſay of him. But ſince you are aware of his inconſtancy, and ſo much concern'd at it, <hi>I</hi> muſt tell you, that to my grief as much as yours, <hi>I</hi> have diſcovered he is other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe engaged. She perceived me bluſh extreamly at that word, and in truth <hi>I</hi> was ſo diſordered with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, it was impoſſible to hide my deſpair. Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe engaged! Madam, ſaid <hi>I,</hi> ſighing: Yes, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered ſhe, to a new Miſtreſs very lately. Judge you, continued ſhe, what <hi>I</hi> ſaid to him on that occaſion, and whether he did deſerve to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached, having expreſt ſo much paſſion for you, that <hi>I</hi> thought it impoſſible a man could have been more deeply in Love. Oh Heavens, cry'd ſhe, how deceitful are men now adays! He excuſed himſelf by the Friendſhip he hath for my Son; that to be his Rival, were to betray him, and that the confidence he had in him, in acquainting him at his arrival, with his offection for you, oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him to make a Sacrifice of his heart, to ſerve my Son's intereſt. Sorry excuſes, <hi>I</hi> confeſs, ſays ſhe, but how can we help it? 'Tis a mercy how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, he knows not the favourable inclination you have for him, for which he is unhappily
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:60459:235"/>
beholding to me, as the cauſe of your kindneſs. He ſhould never have known theſe worthy incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, reply'd <hi>I: I</hi> never diſcovered them to any but your ſelf Madam, for whom <hi>I</hi> had no reſerve, and I hope you have not told him. Think not, ſays ſhe, <hi>I</hi> could ſo far forget my ſelf: though <hi>I</hi> were not ſo much your Friend as you know <hi>I</hi> am; <hi>I</hi> know very well with what caution to manage their concerns, who repoſe a confidence in me. Then <hi>I</hi> asked her trembling, whether ſhe knew the fair Lady had robbed us of him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That, ſays ſhe, I cannot learn of him, but <hi>I</hi> will endeavour to diſcover it by my Son, who without queſtion knows who ſhe is; leave that to me and <hi>I</hi> will bring you news of her as ſoon as <hi>I</hi> can diſcover her.</p>
                  <p>Thus did my Rival triumph and laugh at me. <hi>I</hi> muſt confeſs I was a very Fool, in that <hi>I</hi> had not then more wit, than to truſt any Woman; but it was the confidence <hi>I</hi> had in her, that blinded me. Yet when <hi>I</hi> call to mind a thouſand things then ſpoken and done, <hi>I</hi> cannot but wonder, <hi>I</hi> who had ſeen ſo much of the world, could not make diſcovery of the treachery they acted againſt me. <hi>I</hi> did nothing but torment my ſelf night and day, and avoided all occaſions of being with the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs, for fear my weakneſs ſhould to my diſgrace prevail over my reſolutions. I ſaw him entertain himſelf commonly with the Viceroys Lady, and asking her one day, what it was they diſcourſed of; and whether ſhe had diſcovered the ſecret <hi>I</hi> was ſo deſirous to know; ſhe anſwered me, no, but that <hi>I</hi> ſhould not trouble my ſelf, for the Marqueſs would come to me again; and that ſhe ſtudied how to bring it about. <hi>I</hi> was vext at this, and told her <hi>I</hi> did not deſire it: that ſhe
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:60459:235"/>
might do her pleaſure, but that <hi>I</hi> deſired to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concerned. And the truth is, the pains <hi>I</hi> endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, would, I believe, by degrees have made me inſenſible, and cured me at laſt But on a day the Viceroy treated us in the Garden<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>I</hi> quitted the Company, and walking aſide to muſe in a dark and ſolitary place, <hi>I</hi> met with the Marqueſs. <hi>I</hi> thought it an effect of the Ladies care, and that ſhe had made uſe of this occaſion to reconcile us. <hi>I</hi> know not whether he took the haughtineſs and ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of the Looks <hi>I</hi> entertain'd him with for an ill Omen, or not; but ſure <hi>I</hi> am, he trembled as he approached me, and with a very ſettled tone, told me, it was very ſtrange to ſee a perſon of my Humour finding out ſo ſolitary a Walk, there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo much good company in the Garden: it had been, ſaid he, excuſable in any other, as an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of ſome amorous thoughts; but for you, Madam—for me, replied <hi>I,</hi> interrupting him, and who hath told you but <hi>I</hi> may have been led hither by Love? Ah Madam, anſwered he, we know you too well to entertain any ſuch ſuſpicion; and <hi>I</hi> am ſure, if you can love any thing, it muſt be only your ſelf. 'Tis well, replied <hi>I,</hi> if it be true as you ſay, that <hi>I</hi> love nothing at all; but as for what you reproach me with, 'tis reported you are not altogether indifferent: there is ſome ground for the report, Madam, indifference being a Quality <hi>I</hi> never ſtood much upon, eſpecially towards you of all the people in the World. What not towards me? replied <hi>I,</hi> when you knew me inſenſible. 'Tis true, Madam, anſwer- he, <hi>I</hi> was told ſo, but ſubmitted however to the deſtiny of thoſe many unfortunate Lovers, you have made ſuch in this Court. In matter of
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:60459:236"/>
affection, ſaid <hi>I,</hi> we are not to be led by example; ſome have more merit or at leaſt better Fortune than others; we are ſenſible towards ſome, when we are not ſo towards others: One perſon ſhall pleaſe, without knowing wherefore, amongſt an infinite of others who ſhall not have that advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, though equally handſom. In a word, every one hath his lucky moment: you may believe <hi>I</hi> could not have ſaid all this without bluſhing; The Marqueſs having heard me with ſuch atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as clearly diſcovered him ſurpriz'd at my diſcourſe, was juſt going to anſwer me, when the Viceroy's Lady, who would never with her good will have us both out of her ſight, unhappily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted us, and ſurprizing us on the ſudden, ſaid, I dare lay a good wager you were, ſpeaking of Love: 'tis true, anſwered I ſmiling we were diſcourſing of a very pleaſant queſtion, occaſioned by being reproached by the Marqueſs for my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſibility. He hath reaſon, Madam, replied the Lady, to prevent an anſwer from the Marqueſs; he who is ſo deeply in Love, may juſtly reproach you: if you know it not, I can aſſure you of it, and will in time tell you more. I thought, ſaid I, we had not been ſo great ſtrangers, but I might have known it from himſelf, without being obliged to another for the News, and if we two were alone, I know how I would quarrel with him for it. All this was ſpoken with an air of raillery, which wrought very effectually on the inclinations of the Marqueſs, which the Lady diſcourſed of; I applied to my ſelf, imagining what ſhe ſpoke of it, was done for my honour, and to engage me to an obliging anſwer, which I gave. She pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:60459:236"/>
fell into other diſcourſe, and led us inſenſibly towards the Company.</p>
                  <p>On the morrow, the Marqueſs having muſed all night on what <hi>I</hi> had ſaid, found me alone look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out at a window of the Palace, and falling in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſibly on the diſcourſe of the day before, asked me, though <hi>I</hi> had no inclination to love, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>I</hi> would be diſpleaſed at one who loved me with the greateſt paſſion in the World: <hi>I</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, there were but few <hi>I</hi> would allow that liberty to; and that in the whole Kingdom <hi>I</hi> knew but one <hi>I</hi> could permit to uſe that privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. <hi>I</hi> believe he could not but underſtand <hi>I</hi> meant him, and my looks did but too much confirm him in the opinion; he, though he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd it, would not take notice of it. <hi>I</hi> know, Madam, ſays he, it is extreamly imprudent to propoſe a Perſon of a meaner rank than yours, or one of ſmall merit, or not Maſter of Qualities worthy your eſteem; but the Perſon <hi>I</hi> ſpeak of, is beyond all exception. Finding him take a courſe ſo contrary to what <hi>I</hi> expected, <hi>I</hi> had not patience to permit him to make an end, having ground enough to believe, it was not for himſelf he made this Declaration; and interrupting him briskly, A Lover, ſaid <hi>I,</hi> (bluſhing with anger and ſhame) perhaps would not diſpleaſe, provided he were like the Marqueſs <hi>Hippolito;</hi> any other may come too late. <hi>I</hi> had ſcarce ſpoken theſe words, but <hi>I</hi> repented me of them, and unwilling to hear any more in the confuſion the torrent of my Paſſion had put me in, <hi>I</hi> withdrew, Oh Heavens! cry'd he, running after to ſtay me, How unfortunate am <hi>I?</hi> Unfortunate, ſaid <hi>I,</hi> turning toward him: Is the eſteem <hi>I</hi> have for you
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:60459:237"/>
a means to make you unfortunate? Yes, Madam, replied he with a ſigh; that precious and charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing eſteem, <hi>I</hi> was made believe, could never be gain'd, which <hi>I</hi> would have purchaſed with all <hi>I</hi> have dear in the World—He ſtopped there. Well, ſaid <hi>I,</hi> what of that eſteem? Ah Madam, anſwered he, they have made me renounce it. <hi>I</hi> had no ſooner heard theſe words, but <hi>I</hi> went on my way, having given him ſome looks full of indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; but ſeeing him follow me, and not able for very grief to ſpeak to him, <hi>I</hi> made ſigns to him with my hand, that he ſhould come no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. It is beyond imagination what a deſperate condition <hi>I</hi> was in that night: Rage, ſhame, ſpite, fury, repentance; in a word, all the Vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of a Lover, mock'd, betrayed, aſſaulted me by turns. <hi>I</hi> fell ſo ſick, that for many days <hi>I</hi> kept my Bed; however <hi>I</hi> reſolved to ſpeak to him once more, to know who had cauſed him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce my eſteem, as he had told me. <hi>I</hi> preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fancied it was <hi>Don Alphonſo;</hi> but was very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous to learn how the matter had been managed, and expected every day to ſee him with his Friend, or with the Viceroys Lady, and that <hi>I</hi> ſhould find an opportunity to ſpeak to him of it. In the mean time he came not to my Chamber, though all the Court did me that honour, for the ſhort time <hi>I</hi> continued indiſpoſed: this ſurprized me extreamly, and hearing one day he was in my Anti-chamber, <hi>I</hi> ſent <hi>Clarice</hi> my Servant to deſire him to come and ſee me, having ſomething to ſay to him. He would have come inſtantly, as the Maid brought me word; but the Viceroys Lady, with whom he was diſcourſing, ſtay'd him: at which <hi>I</hi> was not a little aſtoniſhed; but much
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:60459:237"/>
more, when ſoon after <hi>I</hi> ſaw him come in, in the company of that Lady. He looked very pale, and his countenance much altered, which contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted not a little to allay my bitterneſs againſt him, though <hi>I</hi> had ſmall reaſon to think my ſelf concerned in honour of that change that appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his looks. You ſee, Madam, ſaid <hi>I</hi> to the Lady at their entrance, this Gentleman muſt be ſent for, if we deſire the pleaſure of his Company. Theſe are favours, continued <hi>I,</hi> not uſual with me, and ſuch as <hi>I</hi> would not by any means have done him, while it was in my power to have any eſteem for him. But ſince he hath told me, they have made him renounce my eſteem, you may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, Madam, <hi>I</hi> am not much diſpoſed to have any eſteem for him; and that what <hi>I</hi> now do, proceeds not from any ſuch cauſe. 'Tis true, anſwered the Lady, he does not deſerve your eſteem but you muſt pardon his Youth. <hi>I</hi> will pardon him, replyed <hi>I,</hi> on condition he will tell me who had the power over his Heart or Wit, to make ſlight of an eſteem not altogether unworthy a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of his Quality; and 'tis for that purpoſe <hi>I</hi> have ſent for him hither. He ſtood mute; ſo that turning my Head towards the Lady, to ask her the reaſon of his ſilence, <hi>I</hi> was again ſurpriz'd to find the Lady in greater diſorder than he. <hi>I</hi> was juſt ſpeaking to him again, when <hi>I</hi> ſaw him riſe to tell me, with trouble in his face; <hi>I</hi> will ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie you, Madam, in that particular, but intreat you let me take a fitter time. A fitter time, ſaid <hi>I,</hi> and why not now? Is it my Lady that hinders you? You know <hi>I</hi> conceal nothing from her. Ah, if it be <hi>I,</hi> ſaid the Lady, <hi>I</hi> will withdraw to leave you at liberty; and with that ſhe retired
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:60459:238"/>
towards a Window, in far greater diſorder than if ſhe had been angry. This made me more curious than ever to hear what the Marqueſs would ſay to me. Yet he declared himſelf no further, but reaching forth his hand towards me, he ſhewed me a Billet, which <hi>I</hi> would not have received on any other occaſion; but in this Conjuncture <hi>I</hi> made no ſcruple of it, believing <hi>I</hi> ſhould find in it the Secret <hi>I</hi> longed for: Hereupon he with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew without ſaying a word. And the Lady returning towards me; Well, Madam, ſaid ſhe, how comes it he is gone, without naming to you the Perſon you have ſo much cauſe to hate? <hi>I</hi> muſt tell you, 'tis <hi>I,</hi> and that will ſurprize you. It really did ſo, the word ſhe had ſpoken having a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoniſh'd me, <hi>I</hi> could ſcarce make her an anſwer: You muſt know then, continued ſhe, that having told me he had been obliged on the account of my Son to change his thoughts of you, and engage himſelf to another Beauty; <hi>I</hi> preſſed him for your ſake to tell me who it was; and after a long refuſal, he had the inſolence to tell me, 'twas <hi>I.</hi> You may imagine how <hi>I</hi> uſed him on ſuch an occaſion: However, <hi>I</hi> was of Opinion, that a little more than ordinary complaiſance <hi>I</hi> had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd for him, had given him that Confidence. But finding him ſenſible of his error, <hi>I</hi> was a little better pacified, and let him ſee he was mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken on all hands. That he ſhould not have quitted the deſign of ſerving you, being unqueſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onably the beſt deſerving in this Court of Paſſion, and eſteem of a Perſon of his Quality, and that he was very ill adviſed to make addreſſes to me, who was neither for Gallant, nor Gallantry. <hi>I</hi> was no ſtranger to the Character of this Lady,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:60459:238"/>
and knew very well what ſhe ſaid was quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the inclinations of her temper. And hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing had leiſure while ſhe ſpoke, to recover my ſelf from the aſtoniſhment ſhe had caſt me in at the beginning of this Diſcourſe, and to obſerve the alteration of her Countenance, <hi>I</hi> made no doubt of her perfidiouſneſs. This, Madam, ſaid <hi>I</hi> very ſeriouſly, was to engage further in my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns than <hi>I</hi> deſerved, and in truth than <hi>I</hi> deſired. You had formerly told me, this young Gentleman would have pleaſed you, had you been as <hi>I;</hi> and ſince he preferred you before me, it was too much for you to part with him for my ſake. <hi>I</hi> did, ſays ſhe, but what <hi>I</hi> ought both for you and my ſelf. This, Madam, replyed <hi>I,</hi> is a piece of more than ordinary Friendſhip; and <hi>I</hi> queſtion very much, whether among the beſt Friends of our Sex, the pleaſure of being beloved by a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon whom all the Ladies of the Court own to be the handſomeſt and beſt accompliſh'd in <hi>Naples,</hi> would not prevail over their Friendſhip, and make it appear that one Woman ſeldom ſcruples to be treacherous to another in caſes of this Nature. But, Madam, methinks what you now ſay, is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what contrary to what you formerly told me of the Paſſion of the Marqueſs then wholly for me, <hi>I</hi> thought ſo then, <hi>I</hi> confeſs, ſaid ſhe, but <hi>I</hi> was miſtaken. And is it not poſſible, you ſhould be now alſo miſtaken, anſwer'd <hi>I,</hi> for <hi>I</hi> have ſome reaſon to doubt it. You do but deceive your ſelf, replyed ſhe. Well, Madam, ſaid <hi>I</hi> with ſome heat, let us try which of us is deceived; peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture it will appear in this Billet <hi>I</hi> received from him. Whereupon <hi>I</hi> fell to the opening of it. The Lady much ſurpriz'd, asked me, if it came
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:60459:239"/>
from the Marqueſs. <hi>I</hi> told her, it did; and that nothing but the curioſity <hi>I</hi> had to clear this Affair, could have prevail'd with me to take it from him, Alas, ſays ſhe, what aſſurance can that give you of the inclinations of a Man who changes them e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very moment; and will, it may be, tell you the ſame he hath told me already. <hi>I</hi> was in ſuch haſte to open the Letter, that <hi>I</hi> made her no anſwer, but fell to reading it, being to this purpoſe.</p>

                        <p>How great an unhappyneſs is it, Madam, in matter of Affection, and great trouble of Heart, to follow other Counſels than thoſe of our Paſſion! Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was Perſon ſo deeply in Love, as I was with you, from the day I firſt had the happineſs to ſee you. And I may very well affirm, I continue ſo ſtill, notwithſtanding the many Oaths I have been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to the contrary. But ſome Perſons, whom I had not the leaſt cauſe to ſuſpect of deſign, having taken the pains to repreſent your humour ſo haughty and inſenſible, that I almoſt deſpair of gaining your eſteem, I was obliged to addreſs my ſelf to ſome more indulgent Beauty; not out of inconſtancy, but to cure my ſelf of a Paſſion, the conſequence whereof I extreamly apprehend. Thoſe who adviſed me to it, were ſo kind as to condeſcend to ſerve me in it: And the truth is, their Complyance was ſuch, being Perſons of Quality, that had not I deſired their Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, I could not have refuſed it. But, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, there are ſome evils for which there is no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy. That which your Eyes have done me is of this nature. If I have committed a fault, in en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaining thoughts of breaking my Chains, I ſmart for it more cruelly than you can deſire. I know not to what extremity my grief would drive me for the time I have loſt, were it not for the hope I have

to redeem it. Be pleaſed, Madam, to give me leave to wait upon you with more Love than ever, and by ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Repentance to deface thoſe ill impreſſions my error have wrought on you, concerning the conſtancy of my Affection. For ſhould you be more haughty and inſenſible than you have been repreſented, yet I am reſolved to die altogether yours.</p>

                  <p>Ah, Traytor, cry'd the Viceroy's Lady, as ſoon as <hi>I</hi> had done reading the Billet, is it poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble he ſhould have the Confidence to juſtifie the moſt viſible inconſtancy man was ever guilty of, and to accuſe others of it? Madam, ſaid <hi>I</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Paſſion, 'tis fit we ſhould hear him ſpeak for himſelf; and if you pleaſe to ſtay, we will ſend for him, and ſee how he will defend himſelf againſt you. Alas, ſays ſhe, what ſhould <hi>I</hi> ſtay for? <hi>I</hi> am not otherwiſe concerned than on your account. You may now do as you pleaſe, but if you will be adviſed by me, ſee him no more. That muſt not be Madam, replyed <hi>I,</hi> though it were but to know who they are he ſpeaks of in the Billet; <hi>I</hi> muſt ſee him once more, and then <hi>I</hi> ſhall underſtand what meaſures to take. <hi>I</hi> had hardly done ſpeaking, but the Murqueſs came in. He thought without doubt the Viceroy's Lady would not have favoured me ſo long with her company, after he had been gone; and the impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience he had to know how <hi>I</hi> took what he wrote in the Billet, or perhaps to tell me what made me ſo earneſt to be informed of, made him preſently return. He was not a little ſurprized to find us together. He was juſt ſtepping back to be gone,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:60459:240"/>
but <hi>I</hi> prayed him to come in. The Viceroy's Lady ſeeing him, and confounded at the ſight of him, or for fear <hi>I</hi> would put him upon making the diſcovery before her, as <hi>I</hi> had certainly done in the condition things were in, ſtood up, and taking him by the hand, turning towards me: <hi>I</hi> have ſomething (ſaid ſhe) to tell him; after which you may ſatisfie your ſelf. This action of hers moved more my pity than my jealouſie. <hi>I</hi> know very well ſhe was not a Woman of the beſt, conduct in the World, but <hi>I</hi> ſhould never have imagined her Paſſion could have carried her ſo far (after all ſhe had ſaid to me) as to make her give in my preſence ſuch an inſtance of her weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. <hi>I</hi> let them go without ſaying a word to one or other, but expected to ſee the Marqueſs again, and aſſured my ſelf of very pleaſant divertiſement by what he ſhould tell me of the Lady: But he came not at all that day, which anger'd me not a little. On the morrow <hi>I</hi> perfectly recovered. My malady was a pure effect of jealouſie and vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and when <hi>I</hi> knew how matters ſtood, <hi>I</hi> was ſoon cured of both: Not but that <hi>I</hi> had rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to fear the Viceroy's Lady. But the ſorry courſe <hi>I</hi> ſaw her take, and her pitiful conduct, ſecured me from the apprehenſion of any harm ſhe could do me: <hi>I</hi> was well enough to appear at Court, but hearing there was a Ball at night, <hi>I</hi> reſolved to be ſick one day more, that <hi>I</hi> might ſteal at night in <hi>Maſquerade</hi> to the <hi>Ball,</hi> and there ſpeak with the Marqueſs. My deſign took not, for he came not thither all the while <hi>I</hi> ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. But by reaſon of my going to and fro to ſeek him out, the Viceroy's Lady knew me, and being Alarm'd at my Diſguiſe, followed me to
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:60459:240"/>
my Chamber, where I was amazed to ſee her, and could not believe it was ſhe. Well, and what News of the Marqueſs, ſaid ſhe? I muſt know that of you, Madam, anſwered I, for I have not ſeen him ſince yeſterday, when you denied me the pleaſure to diſcourſe him one moment in a buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs you and I were ſufficiently concern'd to be ſatisfied in. I believe, reply'd ſhe, you are not now to ſeek for ſatisfaction. How can that be, reply'd I, when I have not ſpoken with him ever ſince. It is reported however anſwer'd ſhe, you were this Evening together in Maſquerade. Thoſe, ſaid I, who report it, are very much miſtaken; but I muſt beg your pardon, Madam, if I tell you there is not any one but you capable of ſuch a miſtake. I know what becomes me, and there are but few who make a doubt of it: Perſons of my Honour are ſeldom guilty of ſuch faults. The Viceroy's Lady having a deſire to vex and fall out with me, never gave over till I had told her part of my mind, and let her underſtand I was not to be fool'd by her. The truths I told her, madded her to that degree, that ſhe broke out into expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions ſo cruelly offenſive, I could not forbear cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and unwilling ſhe ſhould have the pleaſure to ſee the Tears run down my Cheeks, I roſe up to retire into my Cloſet What, ſays ſhe, I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupt your Meditations in the Charms of your fine Marqueſs, is not that the cauſe of your with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing? Or rather, continued ſhe, to provoke me yet more, are you going to ſeek him in your Cloſet where you have hid him? That which you ſay, Madam, doth ſo little become you, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but extream madneſs could have made you think ſo unworthy of me; but I ſee what pleads
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:60459:241"/>
your excuſe. What, reply'd ſhe, I hope I have no great reaſon to truſt her that will not truſt me. And the right I have to over-ſee and regulate your Conduct gives me the priviledge to viſit any place I ſuſpect. With that ſhe took up a Flambeau that lay lighted on my Table, and went up towards my Cloſet: I looked upon her with that ſlight and indifference as wholly unconcern'd at her Action, which angred her more than any thing I could have ſaid to her. I do not yet know what was her deſign; for ſhe knew me too well to have the leaſt ſuſpicion of what ſhe charged me with, but it ſeems ſhe was reſolv'd to try me to the utmoſt, and be reveng'd of me that way. In the mean time, by very ill Fortune for me, the Marqueſs was in the Cloſet, and ſhe was the firſt that diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered him; ſhe ſhrieked out with the ſurprize of it, which made me turn about that way, and put me into ſuch a fright, that together with the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure that accident gave me, caſt me into a ſwoon, and made me fall as dead upon the Bed near which I then ſtood. The Marqueſs, ſeized with true or feigned grief for his being the cauſe of ſo unhappy an accident, begged my pardon on his Knees with Tears in his Eyes. What the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſaid to this I know not, but one of my Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber-Maids, who came to help me, told me ſhe ſaw her go out ſo angry, that fire ſeemed to ſparkle out of her Eyes. When I was come to my ſelf, I ſaw her not, but the Marqueſs kneeling before me with a countenance ſo ſad and ſo dejected, it melted me into pity, and e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſed me of more than half of my anger. What have you done, Sir, ſaid I? you have utterly ruined me. Go and ſee me no more but at ſeaſonable Hours, and when
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:60459:241"/>
every body might ſee me; after which, though I was very well pleaſed with his Company, I pray'd him to withdraw, to prevent further occaſion of Diſcourſe.</p>
                  <p>I am ſenſible, dear <hi>Aſſen,</hi> I ſpend too much time in relating particulars ſo inconſiderable, and abuſe your Patience in entertaining you with ſuch trifles. But this having been the beſt of my time in that Court, and beſt part of my ſtory, you will excuſe the difficulty I find in my ſelf to come to the relation of Accidents ſo ſhameful for me, that the memory of them is more terrible than Death. <hi>Aſſen</hi> having anſwered; that all ſhe had ſaid was very material; and that he thought himſelf equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concerned in the ſmalleſt Circumſtances of her Life, as well as the greateſt, ſhe proceeded in this manner.</p>
                  <p>The Viceroy's Lady having fallen out with me, and finding reaſon enough of difference with the Marqueſs, who in ſpite of her viſited me often, you may believe ſhe paſt her time very melancholy and ſad. The firſt time the Marqueſs came to ſee me, I inſiſted, that if he deſigned to pleaſe me he ſhould begin to do it by telling me in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar all the kindneſs and careſſes paſt between the Viceroy's Lady and him. But he intreated me with ſo much Ingenuity, not to make uſe of the power I had over him, to oblige him to a thing ſo mean, that his Diſcretion prevailed over my Curioſity, and made me eſteem him the better for it: however he let me know 'twas of her he ſpoke in the Billet, as I had eaſily gueſs'd. The diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolate Lady, who could not but be concern'd for us, was willing to ſeek Peace, and having found a fair pretence for it, ſent me word by one of her
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:60459:242"/>
Women, that I might do her a pleaſure if I would give her a Viſit, which I fail'd not to do. She received me chearfully, and with ſmiles in her Countenance, ſhe being an Excellent Miſtreſs of the Art of Diſſembling, after ſome Civilities ſhewed me, ſhe brought me to the Cloſet, where begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning her Diſcourſe with a very great ſigh, Well, my dear <hi>Elenor,</hi> ſaid ſhe, are you ſtill angry with me? I am heartily ſorry, Madam, ſaid I, that you gave me cauſe, who never deſerved it. Come, let us agree, ſaid ſhe, to ſay nothing of what is paſt, and give me leave to let you ſee I am your Friend. It is that I deſired, Madam, reply'd I; and the Honour I have always had for you, muſt needs make you believe your Friendſhip very precious and dear to me. 'Tis enough, ſaid ſhe; come tell me preſently, if there were a propoſal of Marriage between the Marqueſs and you; do you love him ſo well, as not to refuſe him? Such a Propoſal from her appeared very ſuſpicious, and ſeeing me laugh, as one who would not be caught in that Trap, <hi>I</hi> do not ſpeak to you now (continued ſhe, as a Rival) as you have believed me to be, and as perhaps (added ſhe ſmiling) <hi>I</hi> have formerly been; but as your true and ſincere Friend <hi>I</hi> tell you, that if you deſire to Marry the Marqueſs, it ſhall be your fault if it be not done; with that ſhe ſhewed me a Letter from the Viceroy to my Father, written to that purpoſe at the requeſt of the Marqueſs, and ſaid, your Father hath ſo much reſpect for my Husband, that there is no doubt but it will take effect; the Marqueſs having de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired my leave to ſpeak of it to the Viceroy: and finding by the Character of the Letter, they endeavoured in good earneſt to unite me to a
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:60459:242"/>
Man who was furniſh'd with all I could wiſh, as well for a ſettlement, as to pleaſe my affection; I was raviſhed with Joy, but let it appear as little as I could, miſtruſting my Fortune, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly being in the hands of a Perſon who would dearly repent it, before it could be effected. I thanked her with the moſt acknowledging and affectionate expreſſions I could invent; and there paſſed ſo many Careſſes on the one ſide and on the other, that you would have thought we had never been ſo great Friends before. At my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn I found the Marqueſs in my Chamber, where he waited to bring me this pleaſing News, with a Countenance full of Joy; and that the <hi>Viceroy</hi> had given him free liberty to viſit me. I told him I had heard all this from a Perſon he could not eaſily gueſs, and in truth it was hardly credible it ſhould be the <hi>Viceroy</hi>'s Lady. I told him it was ſhe, and related all our Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe.</p>
                  <p>The Liberty granted the Marqueſs to viſit me when he pleaſed, having heightned the affection we had one for another, degenerated by degrees into a kind and tender familiarity. He took a little more upon him than had been allowed him, and more indeed than I ought to have permitted him. But 'tis hard for one in <hi>Love,</hi> ſo deeply as I was, to be proof againſt the Amorous aſſaults of a Man ſhe expects to be her Husband on the Morrow. At firſt I made reſiſtance enough, and would not ſo much as give him my hand to kiſs; but Love blinds ſo, that he doth inſenſibly lead us away, and accuſtom us to things we never durſt think of. After the firſt bluſh, the reſt follows of courſe. We expected with equal impatience my
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:60459:243"/>
Fathers anſwer. We were already mutually en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged, ſo that if his anſwer ſhould not have proved favourable, we were reſolved to compleat our happineſs: Such engagements given to ſave a Maids Honour, are but ſnares Love lays for her Virtue. The Marqueſs, as all true Lovers, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing impatiently earneſt for the poſſeſſion of my Perſon as well as Affection, whereof he was aſſured, and fearing croſs Accidents that might hinder our Bliſs, let me know, amongſt ſome little favours I allowed him to take, that he was very deſirous to obtain of my gift what I had forbid him to hope without my Fathers conſent; and that if I loved him, I would make it appear in obliging him in that particular. I made as if I did not underſtand him, but by degrees he ſpoke ſo intelligibly, that I was under the neceſſity of being very angry with him, or of defending my ſelf with Arguments: Finding it impoſſible to be angry with a Man I loved, I fell to Diſputing, but he was too hard for me. And certainly, in matters of Love, a Maid that comes to reaſoning, is in danger of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing loſt. However our combat laſted long enough, to make me fancy I had ſatisfied my humour; but at laſt I muſt yield. I thought there needed not ſo much caution, with a perſon who had given the <hi>Viceroy</hi> his word that he would marry me, and aſſured me, (as I believed) by a thouſand Oaths, that he would make me his Wife. He was to come to me in my Chamber at night, an hour after all ſhould be in bed; and becauſe my Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber was near that of the <hi>Viceroys</hi> Ladies, where <hi>I</hi> had liberty of entrance at my pleaſure, <hi>I</hi> told him <hi>I</hi> would leave the door open, and pray'd him not to make a noiſe, or ſpeak a word, leſt the Lady
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:60459:243"/>
ſhould hear us. You ſee, <hi>Aſſen, I</hi> conceal nothing from you; though I might alledge many reaſons in excuſe of my fault. I cannot tell you all this without bluſhing; for I muſt confeſs had I been more wiſe, or more prudent, I could not have been ſo unfortunate as I am. The <hi>Viceroy</hi> was gone that day out of Town; all things ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to favour us, but it was for my ruin. The hour was come, and I heard a man entring ſoftly into my Chamber, for there was no light to ſee him by, and I eaſily believed it was my dear Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant. I received him with the kindneſs of a Woman in Love, and made no doubt but it was he; for he had the ſame imbroider'd Waſtcoat, which he had cauſed to be made againſt our Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, being one of the richeſt ever ſeen in the Court. Part of the night we paſs'd in an amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous ſilence, till at laſt he fell aſleep. As for me, I found my ſelf a little indiſpoſed, and wanting a light to find ſomething to take, I ventured to go into the Ladies Chamber, which commonly had a watch-light burning all night. Having opened the door from my Chamber to hers, I was not a little ſurprized, when approaching the watch-light, and caſting my eyes towards her to ſee if ſhe were a-ſleep, the Curtains being all open becauſe of the hot weather, I ſaw a man in his cloaths ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by her. I doubted very much whether it were beſt to go back whence I came, or take away the watch-light; but the need I had of this prevail'd with me to go on, and light the candle I had in my hand; and having ſeen ſo much, I was poſſeſt with a Spirit of curioſity to know who that fortunate Gallant might be; I perceived him in the habit of Marqueſs <hi>Hippolito.</hi>
                     <pb n="132" facs="tcp:60459:244"/>
I was ſurpriz'd at the adventure, and had I not been fully perſwaded I had newly left him in my Chamber, I do not know what extravagan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces I might have run into. However this Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance inflamed my deſire of knowing who it was. I perceived he was of the ſame ſtature with the Marqueſs, and had the ſame hair; the Ladies arm was over his face, ſo that I could not ſee it. I was at the beds feet, and could not be miſtaken; I trembled all over, as an Omen of my misfortune. Heavens! ſaid I within my ſelf, am I awake or aſleep? is not that the Marqueſs? could he quit me this night to come to this Lady? perhaps they held correſpondence together, and ſhe knew he was to paſs this night with me. All theſe Reflections were made in a moment, and the next moment after that, I came into my own Chamber, to find out the truth. But how was I aſtoniſhed to find the Marqueſs there too? Oh Heavens! cry'd I, which of the two is the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit? And drawing near him in my Chamber, I perceiv'd by the colour of his Hair, how unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily I was deceived, and that it was <hi>Don Alphonſo</hi> was there. What a Fury, what Rage did this put me in? I ſeiz d the Ponyard he had laid on my Table, and not knowing with which of the three to begin, being all equally perfidious, I thought the Marqueſs as moſt criminal, was firſt to be ſacrificed to my juſt revenge, for fear of an Eſcape. So that I went into the other Chamber; but the noiſe that I made, having awaked <hi>Don Aphonſo,</hi> he was amazed to ſee a Light, and perceiving me enter his Mothers Chamber, he got up in a trice, and frightned at the ſight of the Ponyard in my Hand, he ran after me, and laid
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:60459:244"/>
hold on me by the Arm, juſt as I was going to ſtab that Traytor the Marqueſs; but he was alſo ſufficiently ſurpriz'd to ſee me lifting up my hand to kill the Marqueſs, lying by his Mothers ſide. He was enraged at the ſight, and to waſh away the ſtain of his Family with the bloud of the Trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, was ready to execute that vengance he had hindred me to take; but I ſtaid him, and throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my ſelf upon him, Traitor, ſaid I, this blow was not reſerved for thee, thou ſhalt not have the pleaſure of being firſt reveng'd. At theſe words, and the buſtle that we made, the Marqueſs and the <hi>Viceroy</hi>'s Lady awaking, were at their wits end, not knowing what reſolution to take. The Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs judging that the Ponyard <hi>Don Alphonſo</hi> had in his Hand, threatned only him, made uſe of the time I held him, to lay hold of his own, and ſtand on his Guard. I left them in this furious Diſorder, hoping they would ſufficiently revenge one on another, for their Treaſon againſt me; and re-entring my Chamber, I ſhut the door on that ſide, and having taken with me all that was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable in money or Jewels, <hi>I</hi> went out at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther door, and ran through the Streets like a mad Woman, to ſeek a Felucca in the Port, to carry me to any place my deſpair would lead me. <hi>I</hi> was ſo unhappy as not to find one ready, and had not the patience to ſtay, for fear of being purſued, and forced back to that Court, where <hi>I</hi> had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther die than appear. At laſt with much ado <hi>I</hi> found a Barque bound for <hi>Barcellona;</hi> provided they went far enough from <hi>Italy,</hi> and that my Name and my Birth were concealed, <hi>I</hi> cared not whither they carried me; ſo that <hi>I</hi> went on board, without taking a moment to conſider. 'Tis
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:60459:245"/>
not a ſingle Accident makes us unfortunate; the greateſt diſaſters have commonly a large train of misfortunes: Thus far my ſoul entertained not a thought, but what the tranſports of deſpair and reſentment had ſuggeſted. But when <hi>I</hi> ſaw my ſelf at Sea, and in no other Company than that of five or ſix poor Mariners, who knew not what to think of me, my heart was ſo full, that nothing could eaſe it but a torrent of tears. <hi>I</hi> will not trouble you with a Relation of the ſad thoughts <hi>I</hi> had for two or three days that <hi>I</hi> had the opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of a ſolitary entertainment; but on the fourth <hi>I</hi> found my ſelf plunged into new afflictions. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Sun-riſing the Sea-men put up ſuch a lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table cry, it almoſt broke my heart: <hi>I</hi> thought we had been Shipwrack'd, and asked what the matter was, more out of curioſity than any fear of death, being the thing <hi>I</hi> heartily wiſh'd for. <hi>I</hi> found the Gallies of <hi>Biſerti</hi> had us in Chaſe, and took us an hour after: <hi>I</hi> received this diſaſter with ſuch tranquility of ſpirit, as really aſtoniſht all the Spectators. All my fear was for my perſon, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fallen into the hands of men who are the moſt barbarous and inhumane on earth, and have no reſpect for our Sex. However, whether it was my particular good fortune, or that they had ſome regard for a Woman which appeared of more than ordinary Quality, <hi>I</hi> may truly ſay, that ſetting aſide the haughtineſs and rudeneſs of their firſt approach, in forcing open the door of my Cabbin with their feet; I was better uſed than the reſt, and more favourably than <hi>I</hi> expected. As ſoon the Souldiers ſaw me, not one of them entred; only the Captain of the Galley took that liberty, and very civilly asked me in <hi>Italian</hi> who <hi>I</hi> was,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:60459:245"/>
and for what place <hi>I</hi> was bound. <hi>I</hi> hid from him both my Name and my Quality, telling him, <hi>I</hi> was called <hi>Laura,</hi> and went for <hi>Barcellona</hi> to my Father; then in the ſervice of the King of <hi>Spain.</hi> Then <hi>I</hi> put into his hand a little Box, in which were my Money and my Jewels; and the more to oblige him, <hi>I</hi> told him <hi>I</hi> made him a Preſent worth above twenty thouſand Crowns (as in truth it was) and that <hi>I</hi> might have thrown it overboard, as moſt of the Sea-men had done their Cloaths and their Merchandize. The acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <hi>I</hi> deſired of him, was that <hi>I</hi> might be civilly uſed; which he promiſed me, and the ſame time told me, <hi>I</hi> ſhould ſay nothing of the Box, aſſuring me of a ſhare at our arrival at <hi>Tunis.</hi> I was raviſhed at this Conjuncture, not ſo much for the hopes he gave me of reſtoring part of my Jewels, but becauſe this ſecret rendred me uſeful and neceſſary to the Captain, and obliged him to a greater care of me. And the truth is, I had no reaſon to complain; he cauſed me to be preſently carried aboard his Galley, and gave me his own Cabbin, and never came into it till we arrived at <hi>Biſerti.</hi> Our Voyage was not long; we had a great Calm, and having in three days gain'd the Cape of <hi>Carthage,</hi> we got ſafe into the Port of <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerti;</hi> where being landed, I was put into a kind of Litter carried by a Camel, and ſo carried to <hi>Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis,</hi> under a Guard of five or ſix Horſe-men. I fell to the <hi>Baſſa</hi>'s ſhare, who, joyful of it, made a Preſent of me to his Lady.</p>
                  <p>Thus you have, dear <hi>Aſſen,</hi> the fortune of a Maid born of an illuſtrious Family, and to a plentiful Eſtate, as you very well know. The <hi>Turk</hi> being perfectly acquainted with the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:60459:246"/>
of her Family, could not ſufficiently admire the ſtrangeneſs of her fate, and aſſured her of his beſt endeavours to make her more happy for the future, and to gain her liberty to return to her Countrey, which ſhe had no cauſe to ſcruple; That the Accident at <hi>Naples</hi> was a diſaſter to be remedied by her Marriage with the Son of the Viceroy, who doubtleſs would be glad of it: That if it ſhould fall out otherwiſe, ſhe had ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny excellencies and advantages to comfort her a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all the diſaſters of her life: That her mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune in the <hi>Neapolitan</hi> Court could not be laid to her fault, but the infamous Treaſon of a Man, who ſooner or later was ſure to be puniſhed for his Crime. In a word, after long diſcourſe to this purpoſe, he renewed proteſtations of his readineſs to ſerve her, and to leave no ſtone unturned to free her from her miſery: That he had many good Friends about the <hi>Dey,</hi> and was very well aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red he could not take any ſiniſter reſolution againſt her, but he muſt have notice of it time enough to prevent, or eſcape it. <hi>Laura</hi> was not wanting to her duty of gratitude, for theſe ſignal teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of Affection to her Family and her; and could not ſufficiently thank Heaven, that in the midſt of her misfortunes ſhe had met a Man ſo devoted to her Service, and of unqueſtionable fidelity.</p>
                  <p>Thus <hi>Aſſen</hi> left her a little comforted againſt the malignity of her deſtiny, and promiſed to come again, and paſs part of the night following with her, being obliged that day to wait on the <hi>Dey,</hi> to ſee how Matters were carried.</p>

                     <hi>ASSEN</hi> got home, but was extreamly aſtoniſh'd the <hi>Moor</hi> was not return'd: he went to Bed, but had very bad reſt, fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome ill accident had befallen the <hi>Moor.</hi> And conſidering of what dangerous conſequence it might be to him in the preſent conjuncture, to be found to have held correſpondence with <hi>Mahomet,</hi> he began to repent he had ſo raſhly expoſed himſelf to diſcovery. The thought of this kept him from ſleeping; but at length the <hi>Moor</hi> arriv'd, and having given him an account what had ſtaid him ſo long, diſſipated his fears, and quieted his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Aſſen</hi> was ſatisfied, took the <hi>Baſſa</hi>'s Letter, read it; and inſtantly diſpatched the <hi>Moor</hi> back again, it being a pretty while before Day, and a fitter time than at the fourth Watch, as the <hi>Baſſa</hi> had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by his Letter.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="138" facs="tcp:60459:247"/>The <hi>Baſſa</hi> was ſurpriz'd to ſee the <hi>Moor</hi> ſo quickly returned; but having heard the reaſon, he was not diſpleaſed, but hid him in his Tent; and as ſoon as it was night, ſent him in ſearch of his General confident and deareſt Friend the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of the Gallies. <hi>Romadan,</hi> ſays he to him, with ſome diſorder in his looks, <hi>what think you of me when I tell you I intend to lye at</hi> Tunis <hi>to night? I muſt tell you Sir,</hi> ſays <hi>Romadan</hi> the Maſter of the Gallies, <hi>I think you too wiſe to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe your ſelf to that hazard, without aſſurance from our Friends there, that they will open you the Gates; nor do I believe you can take pleaſure in putting your Country to Fire and Sword. You un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand me not,</hi> replies the <hi>Baſſa, when I tell you I deſign to lye at</hi> Tunis <hi>to night, 'tis not to execute my juſt vengeance againſt it; I am too tender of the Blood of my Friends, to revenge my ſelf by night, when I cannot diſtinguiſh my Friend from my Foe; I ſpeak of going thither, only attended by a</hi> Moor <hi>I have here, to ſpeak with</hi> Aſſen, <hi>to learn what paſs'd at the</hi> Divan, <hi>to enter the Caſtle, ſee</hi> Laura, <hi>and return. Romadan</hi> heard him with that attention and ſilence, which ſufficiently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd his wonder and aſtoniſhment. He thought it unneceſſary to uſe reaſons to diſſuade him from a deſign ſo raſh and extravagant. The <hi>Baſſa</hi> who read in his looks the ſubſtance of what he might have ſaid to him. <hi>I confeſs,</hi> ſays he, <hi>I expoſe my ſelf to ſome hazard, and that it is imprudence, or (you may call it) folly to run ſuch a riſque; but that matters not, and to eaſe you of the fear of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing charg'd for not telling me what you think of the buſineſs, I declare to you, I ſent not for you to ehav your advice, whether I ought to put it in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:60459:247"/>
or not, for that's already reſolved. The ſtory they tell me of my Wife, that ſhe is gone away with the Chriſtian, and that</hi> Laura <hi>is at home with the</hi> Dey, <hi>are the things that prevail with me, nothing but a ſight of her, can convince me 'tis true; the more I think of it, the more it perplexes me: I would be ſatisfied at leaſt how the buſineſs was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, and there is no knowing it but by the Slave. However, were the reaſons I have told you not ſufficient to make you approve of the deſign, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not refuſe an irreſiſtible paſſion to ſo ſmall a compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Baſſa</hi> having ſaid this, held his peace, in expectation of <hi>Romadan</hi>'s anſwer, who having for ſome time fixt his eyes on the ground, lift them up on the ſudden, ſaying, <hi>God preſerve you Sir from the miſchief you run into; but if it be ſo or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained, you cannot avoid your deſtiny.</hi> Then he ſhewed him the many obſtacles and dangers he ſhould meet with before he could get to <hi>Aſſen.</hi> How impoſſible it was to effect ſome of the things he deſired; that he could not enter the Caſtle without being diſcovered, and that for a ſight of a Chriſtian Girl his Slave, he hazarded the ruin of himſelf, his friend, and his party, that a little patience would make him maſter of his deſigns without pains or danger. The <hi>Baſſa,</hi> inſtead of being perſwaded by <hi>Romadan</hi>'s reaſons, expreſs'd by his countenance a viſible impatience to hear a diſcourſe ſo unneceſſary and uſeleſs after the reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution he had taken. His paſſion tempted him to try his fortune, and deprived him of patience as incompatible with love.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="140" facs="tcp:60459:248"/>The night being pretty well advanced, he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſed himſelf the beſt he could; and having gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven <hi>Romadan</hi> ſuch orders as were neceſſary, that his abſence might not be perceived, he went away with the <hi>Moor,</hi> who led him a way he came the night before: they entred the Town without meeting any, but being hard by <hi>Aſſen</hi>'s Houſe, they fell among a company of People belonging to the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>van,</hi> the <hi>Baſſa</hi>'s ſworn Enemies: But by good fortune he paſs'd undiſcovered, for which he was obliged to the <hi>Moor,</hi> who being a witty fellow, told thoſe who would have ſtaid them, that he was one ſick of the Plague, whom he had in charge to carry to the Peſt-houſe. This made them ſtand at a diſtance, and give them free paſſage; though that diſeaſe be not ſo dreadful there as in other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, being very common and ordinary in thoſe parts.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Baſſa</hi> was glad of ſo eaſie an eſcape; and when he got to <hi>Aſſen</hi>'s, he rewarded the <hi>Moor</hi> according to the merit of ſo conſiderable a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Aſſen</hi> was abroad at the <hi>Baſſa</hi>'s arrival, but was extreamly ſurprized at his return to ſee the <hi>Baſſa</hi> there. <hi>Ah! Sir,</hi> ſaid he, embracing him, <hi>is it poſſible you would hazard your ſelf thus? it might have been excuſable in a hare-brain'd young fellow, who had nothing to loſe but his life, but for a man of your prudence and conduct, (being the ſecond Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Kingdom) to come, without deſign per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, at leaſt without neceſſity, to throw your ſelf into your Enemies hands, and expoſe your life to a thouſand dangers. This Sir, how ill ſoever you take it, is a thing I can never pardon you: For
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:60459:248"/>
Sir,</hi> adds he, <hi>what could have oblig'd you to hazard your ſelf thus?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Baſſa</hi> fell a laughing, and taking all in good part that was ſpoken by <hi>Aſſen,</hi> whoſe kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs he was aſſured of, asked him if he had ever been in love, and whether he knew not that love had made the greateſt of men guilty of faults, and that thoſe faults had always their pardon. <hi>But Sir,</hi> ſaid <hi>Aſſen, what have you to do with love? is it not</hi> Laura <hi>you are in love with? and is not ſhe in the Caſtle? Yes,</hi> replies the <hi>Baſſa, but being in your cuſtody, it cannot be impoſſible to have a ſight of her. Aſſen</hi> would have diſſuaded him from the deſign, as the moſt extravagant and raſh he had ever enterprized; but prevailed no more than the maſter of the Gallies. Strength of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and fear of dangers are obſtacles too weak to ſtop the progreſs of a paſſionate Lover. Love feeds upon hope, and death is not half ſo formi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable as the happineſs of ſeeing a Miſtreſs is charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and pleaſant. The <hi>Baſſa</hi> reſolved, whatever befell him, to go into the Caſtle. But it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to do it by Night, the Gates being then open only for <hi>Aſſen,</hi> and others the <hi>Dey</hi>'s principal Officers. So that it muſt of neceſſity be between Nine in the Morning and Six at Night; and the ſtrict Examination they uſed in that time would have cool'd any Man but the <hi>Baſſa</hi> from proceeding in ſo diſperate a deſign. But thoſe <hi>Southern</hi> Lovers are too hot to be coold by Obſtructions that appear invincible to others. Aſſen <hi>told him, he had no better way than to put him into one of the Meal-ſacks he had order to ſend into the Caſtle on the morrow in a
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:60459:249"/>
Cart.</hi> The <hi>Baſſa</hi> was content, and thought it an excellent invention; and that there could be no danger in it at all. Having reſolved on this, they paſt part of the Night in Diſcourſe of the preſent poſture of Affairs, what paſt at the <hi>Divan,</hi> what deſigns the <hi>Dey</hi> had, what Forces were raiſed, and ſuch other particulars as were neceſſary for the <hi>Baſſa</hi> to know. After this, they went to Bed, where <hi>Aſſen</hi> took his reſt; but as for <hi>Mahomet,</hi> he had no mind to ſleep, he dreamt waking of the happineſs of ſeeing the fair <hi>Laura</hi> on the morrow.</p>
                  <p>At length the day appear'd, and the Cart was loaded with Meal-ſacks for the Caſtle, and among them the Bag with the <hi>Baſſa</hi> in't, was ſo plac'd, that he lay pretty conveniently. The <hi>Moor</hi> led the Horſes, and <hi>Aſſen</hi> walked at ſome diſtance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; the Caſtle-gate was opened, and no ſearch made in the Cart, the <hi>Dey</hi>'s Secretary was Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonally Convoy to. They paſt freely to the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gazin of Victuals, where ſeveral <hi>Moors</hi> inſtantly attended to unload; but <hi>Aſſen</hi> very dextrouſly got rid of them, ſending them away on ſeveral Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rands. This was well for the <hi>Baſſa,</hi> who having been almoſt ſtifled in the Bag, had untyed it, to take a little breath, and had certainly been diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, had thoſe <hi>Moors</hi> ſtaid in the Magazin. <hi>Aſſen</hi> left him there all that day, not thinking it fit to bring him to <hi>Laura</hi> till Night; ſo that he locked him up there, took the Key in his Pocket, and went to the <hi>Dey</hi>'s Palace to learn what News.</p>
                  <p>Poor <hi>Laura</hi> being all day alone, thought it ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry long, and with great impatience wiſh'd for the
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:60459:249"/>
Night, that ſhe might have a ſight of her dear Friend <hi>Aſſen.</hi> At length the hour came he uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally viſited her, but no news of <hi>Aſſen,</hi> which troubled her extreamly. At laſt, ſhe heard the Door open, and riſing to meet him, <hi>Did you but know,</hi> Aſſen, ſays ſhe, <hi>the Sufferings I lye under in the condition I am in, having no Friend but you, you would not have made me pine ſo long for a ſight of you; for in good truth, I am half dead with ſtaying for you. Aſſen</hi> fell a laughing, and turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about to the <hi>Baſſa,</hi> who followed him, here is one, <hi>ſays he,</hi> knows how to bring you to Life again, and I doubt not but for his ſake you will pardon my long ſtay. <hi>Aſſen</hi> had not told the <hi>Baſſa</hi> of the Ancient intimate Acquaintance he had with <hi>Laura;</hi> this made him interrupt her ſo quickly, to make her take notice of him. But he was ſo white all over with lying in the Meal-ſack, that ſhe took him for one of <hi>Aſſen</hi>'s Men; but ſeeing him laugh, ſhe viewed him more nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly, and knew him, <hi>Oh Heavens! is it you, Sir,</hi> ſays ſhe. <hi>Oh? whither are you come in ſearch of an unfortunate wretch, which hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready given you ſo much trouble, and too great cauſe of complaint!</hi> It is eaſie, anſwers the <hi>Baſſa,</hi> to pardon thoſe we love. But is it poſſible you are here, and that the <hi>Sultaneſs</hi> is gone away in your ſtead? tell me, was it ſhe that betray'd you, or was it <hi>Alexander? I</hi> know not what to think of it; but when <hi>I</hi> conſider his proceedings in this laſt adventure, <hi>I</hi> cannot ſuſpect him tracherous. For 'twas not his fault <hi>I</hi> diſcovered not the <hi>Sulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taneſs,</hi> it was <hi>I</hi> hindred him to take off her <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> that I might ſee her. However, if he loved
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:60459:250"/>
you, I am ſufficiently Reveng'd of you, for you have loſt more than I; and if he was falſe to you, you may comfort your ſelf with the aſſurance of the affection of a Perſon not ſo unworthy of your favour as he was. Theſe laſt words put <hi>Laura</hi> to the bluſh; but making no anſwer to them, <hi>As for me, Sir,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>I neither loſt a Lover in him, nor have cauſe to charge him with falſhood, but muſt lay on my ill Fortune all the blame of my being left behind him.</hi> You ſurprize me much, replies the <hi>Baſſa,</hi> and make me conclude you an excellent Diſſembler, or my ſelf the moſt abuſed Man in the World. <hi>Call to mind, Sir,</hi> ſays Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra, <hi>What I told you ſo often, that my affection for</hi> Alexander <hi>was very indifferent; and to be taken off when I pleaſed. The Ladies of your Country differ very much from thoſe of Chriſtendom in their courſe of Love; yours are very ſuſceptible, eaſily take impreſſion, and are equally unconſtant. Ours are more ſhi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> of engaging in Love, but when engaged, their love is more laſting. You believed me a</hi> Turk, <hi>and ſeveral times did me Honours, due only to the</hi> Sultaneſs <hi>whom you often miſtook for me.</hi> The <hi>Sultaneſs,</hi> replies the <hi>Baſſa,</hi> much ſurpriz'd at the News. <hi>The very ſame, Sir,</hi> ſays Laura, <hi>for 'tis now time to diſabuſe you; and ſince I may juſtly glory to have made of my Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for</hi> Alexander <hi>a Sacrifice to her Love, I may now be allowed to declare it, when ſhe is out of all danger of inconvenience by my owning it.</hi> The <hi>Sultaneſs,</hi> Sir, continued ſhe, more affected than I with the good qualities of that Chriſtian, looked upon him as worthy of her Love. But permit me to ſay, you may thank your ſelf for it, who
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:60459:250"/>
firſt ſought out the means to gain the Honour of finding a Gallant for your Lady. You may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, replies the <hi>Baſſa,</hi> I deſign'd no ſuch matter, yet I pardon it in a Woman I had no kindneſs for. But the falſeneſs of the Chriſtian was unpardonab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly baſe, who beſides the regard he ſhould have had for the daily favours I did him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ought to have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved at leaſt the Laws of Hoſpitality. The <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taneſs,</hi> Sir, ſaid <hi>Laura,</hi> had a Beauty of power to corrupt the moſt upright of Men; and had ſhe been anothers Wife, I durſt not have undertaken for your integrity in the caſe. I had a deſire to ſee the Chriſtian; you brought him into the <hi>Sera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glio;</hi> ſhe had a ſight of him: He was handſom, ſhe loved him, and told him ſo; what could he do? The <hi>Baſſa</hi> could not forbear laughing at her relating the ſtory. And 'tis all the concern the <hi>Turks</hi> expreſs for the falſeneſs of their Wives, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially thoſe they have no love for, having <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raglio's</hi> well ſtor'd, and the priviledge to change Wives at pleaſure. The <hi>Baſſa</hi> very patiently took the loſs of his <hi>Sultaneſs,</hi> and told <hi>Laura</hi> it muſt be her fault if he ſhould not be now more happy than ever. The ſubtil Slave, very ſenſible how uſeful he might be to her in the preſent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juncture, thought it unſeaſonable to give him a repulſe, but reſolv'd to manage to advantage ſo good an overture; ſhe told him only, that was not a time to make Love. <hi>You ſee, Sir,</hi> conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues ſhe, <hi>I am here in a Priſon, I know not how to get out of.</hi> But <hi>I</hi> know how to do it, replies the <hi>Baſſa</hi> haughtily; and if within three days you be not at Liberty, I'le fill the Streets of this Town with the Bodies of the Inhabitants. <hi>Ah Sir! an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers</hi> Laura, <hi>that were the way not to ſave me,
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:60459:251"/>
but to haſten my Death. And it being known I am the cauſe of this Diſorder, you may eaſily gueſs what Mercy I ſhall find. If you have, Sir, any value for my Life, ſince it may be ſaved without ſhedding Blood, and that matters are now in a way of accommodation, let me intreat you not to think of thoſe horrible extremities.</hi> Believe me, ſays the <hi>Baſſa,</hi> 'tis their deſign to amuſe me, till the Troops they expect from <hi>Tripoly</hi> be arriv'd; but <hi>I</hi> ſhall take Order for that, and if you will prevent inconveniences that may happen, you muſt reſolve to get out hence this Evening, and go along with me. <hi>Get out hence, Sir, replies</hi> Laura, <hi>and how ſhall it be done, out of a Caſtle where I am under Guard, and have ſo many Gates to paſs?</hi> You ſee, ſays the <hi>Baſſa,</hi> ſpight of all thoſe Guards, and thoſe Gates, <hi>I</hi> have entred, and reſolve to get out again; and may not you ſo too? <hi>But, Sir,</hi> ſays Laura, <hi>conſider I am a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and however diſguiſed, may be eaſily diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered by my gate, or my ſtature; and the leaſt obſtacle we meet with, will put me into ſuch a fright, will infallibly ruin both you and me. Aſſen</hi> fortified her Reaſons with his, and abſolutely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned the Enterprize propoſed, as expoſing the <hi>Baſſa</hi> and her to apparent danger of inevitable ruin. You ſhall ſee, <hi>Sir,</hi> adds he, by the difficulty you and <hi>I</hi> ſhall find to get out, the trouble we ſhould have to get a Woman along with us. <hi>I</hi> am of Opinion with the reſt of your Friends, 'tis beſt to come to an accommodation. The Troops from <hi>Tripoly</hi> will be long a coming, and if you keep the Town ſtreightly block'd up a few days longer, you will oblige the People to Petition the <hi>Dey</hi> to make Peace, which we of your Party will
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:60459:251"/>
not fail to help forward: And the <hi>Dey</hi> being of a timerous irreſolute temper, will be glad of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence to come to an Agreement.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Baſſa,</hi> though more inclin'd to violent than moderate actions, yielded this time to the perſwaſion of two Perſons who were the deareſt to him of any, and whoſe intereſt he knew it was not to give him any Counſel to his diſadvantage. He told them he would ſtay a Week longer, but if in that time neither the Threats nor Interceſſion of his Friends ſhould prevail, he would make uſe of ſome Stratagem to reduce the Town; and if that failed, he would employ all his Force to bring the <hi>Dey</hi> to Reaſon.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Aſſen</hi> was eaſily induced to aſſent to all this, knowing the Town was ill provided of Corn, and that the Inhabitants began already to be ſtreightned, and murmured at the exigences they were reduc'd to, and not without cauſe, although it was given out theſe murmurs were raiſed by thoſe of the <hi>Baſſa</hi>'s Party, in favour of his deſigns.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Baſſa</hi> ſhifting his Diſcourſe from the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral affairs to his private concerns, deſired <hi>Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra</hi> to give him a particular account of <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>'s Amour with the <hi>Sultaneſs,</hi> which <hi>Laura</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated in the moſt civil expreſſions ſhe could, not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting the Adventure in the Chamber of Repoſe, where the <hi>Baſſa</hi> had miſtaken his Lady for her: the <hi>Baſſa</hi> could hardly believe this, and was more vext at it, than all the reſt of the ſtory. Then ſhe told him the deſign the <hi>Sultaneſs</hi> and ſhe had to go both aboard, and why the <hi>Sultaneſs</hi> had put her ſelf into the Basket without acquainting <hi>Alexander</hi> with her intentions. <hi>I</hi> do verily believe it, ſaid the <hi>Baſſa,</hi> for <hi>I</hi> was in the Chamber when the
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:60459:252"/>
Basket was brought in, and feign'd it was you; and was unwilling <hi>Alexander</hi> ſhould do you the leaſt violence. <hi>I</hi> gave Order my ſelf to have it carried aboard, and together with <hi>Alexander</hi> went along with it to the Port. <hi>Aſſen</hi> and <hi>Laura</hi> could not forbear laughing. The <hi>Baſſa</hi> told them he was as ready to laugh at it as they, but that <hi>Laura</hi> made one of the party, and had a hand in putting the trick on him. For as for his Wife, the hatred he bore her Father, and the ſmall kindneſs he had for her, were ſufficient aſſurances he was not ſorry to be rid of her. But he expected ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from <hi>Laura</hi> for the ill Offices ſhe had done him; none being more guilty than ſhe of the Treaſon of the <hi>Sultaneſs.</hi> Raillery made up the reſt of the Diſcourſe, and the Night being far gone, <hi>Aſſen,</hi> not affected as the <hi>Baſſa</hi> with the Charms of <hi>Laura,</hi> told him it was time to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw. The <hi>Baſſa</hi> intreated him to ſtay a little longer, and ſaid, while Night laſted, he thought there was no danger; and that he had not taken ſo much pains to enjoy that lovely Girl only for a moment. At laſt, <hi>Laura</hi> acquainted him with the fear ſhe was in, having been ſo long toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which heightned the danger; giving the Guards cauſe to ſuſpect ſo long an interview, and to ſtop his paſſage if he ſtaid much longer. The <hi>Baſſa,</hi> to ſatisfie her, retired, making new pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtations of a Paſſionate Lover, who would rather periſh a thouſand times, than not ſee her delivered from the hands of her Enemies by an Honourable Peace, or a bloody War.</p>
                  <p>A new invention muſt be thought of for the getting out of the Caſtle, where the Examination was as ſtrict almoſt at going out as at entrance.
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:60459:252"/>
                     <hi>Aſſen</hi> led the <hi>Baſſa</hi> back again to the Magazin, and having daubed his Face ſufficiently with Meal, laid a parcel of empty Sacks on his ſhoulders, without any diſturbance, paſt all the Guards with him, as a Servant of <hi>Aſſen</hi>'s. It was not yet day; and the <hi>Baſſa</hi> thought it fit to make uſe of his time, to return before Morning to the Camp, where he thought his preſence very neceſſary. <hi>Aſſen</hi> bore him company to the Walls of the Town, and having belp'd him over, took his leave.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Laura</hi> longed extreamly to hear what was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of him, and could not reſt till ſhe ſaw <hi>Aſſen. Cheer you, Madam,</hi> ſaid he, as he entred her Chamber. <hi>The</hi> Baſſa <hi>is out of danger, and all will be well. Alas! dear</hi> Aſſen, anſwers ſhe, <hi>perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture things may go well, but not for me.</hi> You will be certainly ſet at Liberty, replies <hi>Aſſen,</hi> and in very few days. <hi>Yes,</hi> ſays <hi>Laura, I ſhall be ſet at Liberty from the</hi> Dey, <hi>to be made Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to the</hi> Baſſa, <hi>whoſe Paſſion will render my Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment a thouſand times more unfortunate than my preſent reſtraint. Heard you not what he ſaid? And what will become of me, when in his power? Ah,</hi> Aſſen, adds ſhe, with Tears in her Eyes, <hi>I did but too clearly fore-ſee the misfortunes that did threaten me, unleſs Heaven divert them. A Maid of my Quality had better die a Priſoner, than buy her Liberty at that rate. Aſſen</hi> ſighing for pity, anſwered, he had already thought of all ſhe ſaid, and that it was not without cauſe, he ſo much oppoſed the <hi>Baſſa</hi>'s deſigns of taking her a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way that Night. That he could have found means enough for it, had he thought it for her advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage; But that he reſolved to repreſent to her firſt, how much harder it would be for her to get out
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:60459:253"/>
of the <hi>Baſſa</hi>'s hands than the <hi>Dey</hi>'s. And that he was very glad ſhe had firſt ſpoken of it; that he would keep his word with her, to do her all the Service he could, to help her back into her Countrey; that he was very ſenſible it was as much as his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune was worth, and perhaps his Life; both which he muſt hazard in the caſe: but that he never ſcrupled to expoſe the one, or the other, but was ready to ſacrifice both for the intereſt of a Family he was more indebted to; and that he was very willing to return among the Chriſtians, whoſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and Cuſtoms he loved far better than thoſe of his Countrey.</p>
                  <p>This uſhered in a long Diſcourſe of the Buſineſs in hand; the Concluſion was, that <hi>Aſſen</hi> ſhould uſe the intereſt of his Friends with the <hi>Dey,</hi> to perſwade him to ſet <hi>Laura</hi> at liberty, and ſend her back into her Countrey, to prevent the Confuſion to be fear'd, if he ſhould be obliged to reſtore her to the <hi>Baſſa,</hi> and ſee her ſupply his Daughter Seat and <hi>Room.</hi> That, if this would not take, he ſhould try the utmoſt extremites, to endeavour the get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting her on board a <hi>Brigandine</hi> of his, which ſhould be made ready to carry her away with the firſt Opportunity. Poor <hi>Laura,</hi> deeply ſenſible of the Obligation ſhe had to ſo honeſt a Man, told him more than once, he might aſſure himſelf, ſhe would not be ungrateful for ſo conſiderable Servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; and that he ſhould never fail of a Friend while ſhe lived, but might command any thing in the power of her Family. <hi>Aſſen,</hi> who needed no promiſes to perſwade him in this particular, took his leave; and went to ſpend the reſt of the Night in thinking of the buſineſs, for which his incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation and gratitude were motives ſufficiently
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:60459:253"/>
powerful to engage his utmoſt endeavours. He ſlept not a wink, but as ſoon as it was day, he went to viſit thoſe he thought to make uſe of, to ſpeak to the <hi>Dey.</hi> Of theſe, <hi>Beyran-Aga,</hi> the <hi>Dey</hi>'s Favourite, was one, in whom he placed moſt confidence, as moſt favouring the Chriſtians, and his particular Friend. He found him ready to ſerve him, but at the ſame time, he deſired the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of ſeeing the Slave. <hi>Aſſen</hi> fearing the effects of her Beauty on a young man, as the <hi>Aga,</hi> might obſtruct the deſign, was ſo far from expreſſing a willingneſs to comply with him, that he ſtrained his invention to find the moſt ſpecious pretences to divert him. <hi>Beyran</hi> took it for a denyal of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, and was ſomewhat diſpleaſed. He thought <hi>Aſſen</hi> was in Love with her, and told him only, he would do him all the Service in his power to perſwade the <hi>Dey</hi> to give the fair Slave her Liberty. But the truth is, he endeavoured it but coldly; ſo that either the <hi>Dey</hi> believed, a time might come he might give <hi>Laura</hi> in exchange for his Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or that the <hi>Baſſa</hi> loving her as he did (in caſe of neceſſity) to make Peace with him, would for her ſake grant him better Conditions, he was not of Opinion with <hi>Aſſen's</hi> Friends, who adviſed him to be rid of her.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Aſſen</hi> much troubled his project had failed, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to put himſelf into a condition of ſtealing her away, hoping to effect it as a thing depending intirely on himſelf. <hi>Beyran</hi> whoſe deſires to ſee <hi>Laura</hi> increaſed, by the difficulty he found of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining it from <hi>Aſſen,</hi> would not ask it of him the ſecond time; but went ſtreight to the <hi>Dey,</hi> to beg leave to ſee her, under pretence of learning from her, the truth of what was reported concerning the
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:60459:254"/>
                     <hi>Sultaneſs,</hi> and the Chriſtian, who was fled. The <hi>Dey</hi> too well aſſured of the amour betwixt them, by the evidence of the <hi>Moor,</hi> who carried the Bas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket; and of ſeveral Women of the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> and other Circumſtances, little needed further Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But <hi>Beyran</hi> being his Favourite, and think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his requeſt proceeded meerly from curioſity of ſeeing the fair Slave, he granted it; and gave order to <hi>Laura</hi>'s Guards to let him ſee her.</p>
                  <p>This Favourite had heard the Slave was very handſom, but could not learn how long ſhe had been at <hi>Tunis,</hi> nor how taken; fortune having ſo ordered it, that he addreſſed his inquiry to Perſons that could give him no certain account.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Aſſen</hi> had been buſie that day, arming his <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gandine</hi> under pretence of ſending her a cruiſing, and commanded his People, being almoſt all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Slaves, to be ready at the Cape of <hi>Carthage</hi> to ſail with the firſt Orders. <hi>Laura</hi> was diſpos'd the the night before, to venture paſſing the Sea in that little Veſſel: The weather was fair, the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon pleaſant, and they hoped, if the wind ſerved, to reach the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ſle of St. <hi>Peter</hi> in two days. <hi>Aſſen</hi> goes to viſit her, and finds her trembling for fear: <hi>Madam,</hi> ſays he, this is not a time to tremble, but to arm your ſelf with Reſolution and Courage. <hi>I am a Woman, Aſſen,</hi> anſwers ſhe, <hi>and one un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy enough to have cauſe to fear the worſt, both for you and my ſelf. Aſſen</hi> endeavoured to hearten her, ſaying, ſhe ſhould be ſet at liberty on the morrow, and that he would take her out of the Caſtle without difficulty or danger. <hi>Laura</hi> was in fear ſtill, and ſo much diſordered, ſhe knew not where to begin to provide for her eſcape; when
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:60459:254"/>
on the ſudden, ſhe heard her Chamber door open, and turning about, ſaw a man enter, which fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned her ſo (apprehending a diſcovery) that ſhe fell in a Swoon with theſe words in her mouth; <hi>Ah! Lord we are undone! Aſſen</hi> extreamly ſurprized at the accident, and the <hi>Moor</hi> foreſeeing the <hi>Aga,</hi> knew not what to think might occaſion his coming thither, believing it could not be, but in behalf of the <hi>Dey.</hi> Both <hi>Beyran</hi> and he were buſie about <hi>Laura,</hi> holding her up, but of the two <hi>Beyran</hi> ſeemed moſt concern'd. He viewed and reviewed her Countenance, her ſtature, her hair, her hands, with a diligence and trouble too extraordinary, not to ſurprize <hi>Aſſen</hi> to whom he had not yet ſaid a word. But all on the ſudden, giving free paſſage to a thouſand ſighs, his ſurprize had ſtopt or ſuſpended: <hi>Oh Heavens!</hi> Cries he as a man tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, <hi>'tis ſhe, tis ſhe, my Dear</hi> Eleanor. And at the ſame time falling down at her knees, embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced them with that tenderneſs and height of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, you would have thought he would have died there for joy. Theſe words and tranſports, and hearing him call her <hi>Eleanor,</hi> ſurprized <hi>Aſſen,</hi> he knew not whether it was the <hi>Aga,</hi> he ſaw there, or ſome other that had borrowed his ſhape. <hi>Laura</hi> the mean while was pretty wellcome to her ſelf, and angry at ſeeing at her feet a man ſhe knew on no other account, but that the ſight of him had almoſt coſt her life, ſtruggled the beſt ſhe could to get from him. But the <hi>Aga,</hi> with eyes full of tears, and not able to ſay a word, held her ſo much the faſter. <hi>Laura</hi> extreamly aſtoniſh'd, <hi>Sir,</hi> ſays ſhe, <hi>if this be an effect of pity, you have for the fortune of an unfortunate Slave, have done <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

<pb n="154" facs="tcp:60459:255"/>
you came on a deſign contrary to my wiſhes.</hi> You little know, <hi>Madam,</hi> ſays the <hi>Aga,</hi> with a lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing tone, the Perſon proſtrate before you.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Laura,</hi> feigning ſhe knew the voice, fixt her eyes on him to take a better view: <hi>Heavens!</hi> cries ſhe, <hi>what do I ſee, is it poſſible it ſhould be he?</hi> With that ſhe falls into a ſecond Swoon into the arms of <hi>Aſſen,</hi> who much troubled at it, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated the <hi>Aga</hi> to withdraw a little, fearing the ſight of him might be the death of the poor Maid, not knowing who he was. <hi>What ſay you,</hi> ſays the <hi>Aga? Alas! ſhe knows me too well, being the ſole cauſe of all her misfortunes. Aſſen,</hi> I know you to be honeſt, and my very good Friend, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I apprehend no danger in telling you, ſhe is a Perſon whoſe Merits as well as Birth make her worthy your Care; and one for whom I would loſe a thouſand Lives to ſave her from harm. <hi>Aſſen</hi> hearing this, fell from one aſtoniſhment to another, and would have fain cleared the Myſtery of the Adventure, but was ſo buſied with endeavouring to fetch <hi>Laura</hi> again, that he thought it convenient to reſpite the Diſcourſe to a fitter Opportunity. The <hi>Aga</hi> extreamly concerned, aſſiſted him with extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary diligence; and <hi>Laura</hi> beginning to take breath, <hi>Aſſen</hi> asked her, if ſhe deſired that <hi>Turk</hi> ſhould quit the Room, and told her, he was the <hi>Aga,</hi> the <hi>Dey</hi>'s Favourite, he had told her of. She making no anſwer, turned her dying Eyes towards the <hi>Aga,</hi> and with a languiſhing voice, <hi>Ah cruel,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>What Fate brought thee hither to perſecute me to Death? Beyran</hi> could not hear that Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, without falling the ſecond time at her feet, and waſhing them with a torrent of tears, without ſpeaking a word: <hi>Leave me Traytor,</hi> ſays
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:60459:255"/>
ſhe, <hi>leave me, that I may dye in quiet, rather than be deluded again with thy tears, which deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully as they are, have but too ſtrong an effect on my feeble heart. Aſſen</hi> the ſpectator of ſo ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a Scene, having freſh in memory the ſtory of <hi>Laura,</hi> with <hi>Marqueſs Hippolito,</hi> and <hi>Don Alphon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo,</hi> knew not what to think of it. The <hi>Aga</hi> was a Renegado arrived at <hi>Tunis</hi> a year before; and <hi>Aſſen</hi> fancied he might be one of thoſe Lovers, and rather the <hi>Marqueſs Hippolito,</hi> than <hi>Don Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phonſo. Laura</hi> in the height of her anger, having expreſs'd a tenderneſs for him, which ſhe could not have retained, but for one ſhe had loved. He had a deſire to know the bottom of the buſineſs, but thought it unſeaſonable to interrupt them, and was in hopes this Scence would end in a diſcovery of the Myſtery. Yet being himſelf ſtreightned in time, and that they were fallen into a deep ſilence, uſing only expreſſions of mutual ſighs. He thought fit to ſay to the <hi>Aga</hi> (whom he ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perceived no Enemy of <hi>Laura</hi>'s) <q>Had my former acquaintance with you been too ſmall to give me hopes, you would not croſs the deſign we have in hand; yet Sir, what I have but now ſeen and heard, were enough to perſwade me, you will be ſo far from obſtructing it, that I aſſure my ſelf, we ſhall have your aſſiſtance to compaſs it. By my requeſt to you yeſterday, you know my endeavours for the Liberty of this Slave: thoſe proved ineffectual, but I have thought of other means, which if you pleaſe, we will execute this evening. You know well enough the <hi>Baſſa</hi> is paſſionately in love with her, if we give him time to ſee her once more, it will not be in our power to get her out of his hands; If a War be
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:60459:256"/>
reſolved on, it will be equally difficult to ſave her: And who knows but ſhe may be put to death here, the People being already extreamly incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed againſt her, as the cauſe of all this diſorder; and upon the noiſe of a War, they will be too apt to make her a Sacrifice. Let us be wiſe in time, all things are in readineſs, and if you will make uſe of them preſently, I do warrant the ſucceſs.</q>
The <hi>Aga</hi> looked upon him as a man newly out of a Trance, and oppreſs'd with grief. Let us do, <hi>Dear Aſſen,</hi> ſays he, whatever you think fit, for in the condition that I am in, I am not capable to give you any reaſonable Counſel, but will do all you ſhall deſire of me, and imploy my whole power in the Caſtle to favour your deſign, and help this Lady out of danger. <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful man,</hi> anſwers <hi>Laura, do you ſpeak of help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me out of danger? you who are the cauſe of all my misfortunes. Go wretch, go, I'le never be ſo much obliged to you, but chuſe rather to dye here in Priſon, than not to have ſtill juſt cauſe to reproach you.</hi> This is not time, <hi>Madam,</hi> ſays <hi>Aſſen,</hi> (whoſe conceptions were too groſs to apprehend the delica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of her Sentiments) to refuſe any help, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the <hi>Aga</hi>'s, who being Captain of the Guard, can give order for opening us the Gates; when we pleaſe, without ſtop or examination. <hi>What confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence can we repoſe,</hi> anſwers ſhe, <hi>in the moſt perfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious of men? No, no,</hi> Aſſen, <hi>were it poſſible for him to be more honeſt on this occaſion, then he was faithful in his love, I will rather dye than make uſe of his aſſiſtance, after the double Treaſon he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted againſt me: The very thought of it,</hi> adds, ſhe with tears, <hi>is more cruel than Death.</hi> 'Tis true, <hi>Madam,</hi> ſays <hi>Beyran,</hi> with the moſt moving
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:60459:256"/>
action imaginable: I have deſerved death, yet peradventure I am not ſo guilty as you think me. <hi>Don Alphonſo</hi> and <hi>Clarice,</hi> who betrayed us both, have expiated their Crimes with Death, and if mine muſt be puniſhed with equal rigor, my life is at your diſpoſe. You ſee me in a Country, <hi>Madam,</hi> whither nothing but deſpair on the news of your death occaſioned my coming; for after di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent ſearch of the way you had taken, having been told you were embarqued for <hi>Barcellona,</hi> I took the ſame road, and arrived at that City, where ſoon after it was reported, the Veſſel you embarqued in was caſt away, and not one Perſon ſaved. Never was grief equal to mine, every one pitied me; nor had I eſcaped death, but that Heaven moved at my tears, reſerved me the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of ſeeing you again, to juſtifie my ſelf before you, and not to dye in your ill opinion, the thing next the loſs of you, I was moſt of all troubled for. The life I have ſince led, hath been full of afflictions ſufficient to expiate any Crime, if not committed againſt you. <hi>Laura</hi> took plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to hear him, and heartily wiſhed to find it true. He was not ſo much to blame as ſhe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved. But the evidence was ſo apparent againſt him, that the very thought of what ſhe had ſeen, made her more angry than ever, ſo that ſhe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded him out of her ſight, bid him quit the Town, and never ſee her more. Poor <hi>Beyran</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>being ſtill on his knees, endeavoured with the kindeſt and moſt tender expreſſions imaginable to pacifie her.<hi>Aſſen,</hi> who by this time was ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently aſſured he was the Marqueſs <hi>Hippolito</hi> under the name of <hi>Beyran,</hi> moved with his tears, took his part againſt <hi>Laura,</hi> whom he thought not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexible,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:60459:257"/>
and intreated her to have ſome regard to the penitence of ſo tender a Lover, ready to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver her out of all her troubles, and free her from Slavery which he had occaſioned; but perhaps without any fault of his, and ſo againſt his will. But <hi>Laura</hi> more angry than before (at leaſt in appearance) anſwered, ſhe valued not her Slavery, but would chooſe rather to return to the <hi>Baſſa,</hi> than go away with a man ſhe hated worſe than Death. This troubled <hi>Aſſen,</hi> but he could not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair to ſee the fair Lady yield at laſt to the pains and tears of a Lover, though ſhe appear'd unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to be overcome by the perſwaſions of a Friend.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Laura</hi>'s heart was of this temper, ſhe thought her ſelf concerned in honour not to yield too ſoon. <hi>Aſſen</hi> did her no ſmall pleaſure in taking the part of Marqueſs <hi>Hippolito,</hi> whom we will yet call <hi>Beyran.</hi> And ſhe was very willing <hi>Aſſen</hi> ſhould have the honour of obtaining from her a pardon for the ungrateful <hi>Beyran,</hi> if he could plead any thing to juſtifie himſelf, or extenuate the Treaſon he was guilty of, but that would have uſhered in a Diſcourſe too long for the preſent conjuncture, and <hi>Aſſen</hi> told the <hi>Aga,</hi> if he had a mind to execute the deſign he had told him of, he muſt be at the Cape of <hi>Carthage</hi> before day; for there the <hi>Brigandine</hi> waited their coming. <hi>Beyran</hi> anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, it was impoſſible to get that night out of the Caſtle, the <hi>Dey</hi> having not above two hours ſince had news from the Spies, he maintained about the <hi>Baſſa,</hi> that the night before, the <hi>Baſſa</hi> entred the Town, whereupon the <hi>Dey</hi> gave ſtrict order no Perſon ſhould go out or in but by day. <hi>Laura</hi> and <hi>Aſſen</hi> were ſurprized at the news, and perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the <hi>Baſſa</hi> had been in danger. <hi>Beyran</hi> ſeeing <hi>Laura</hi> a little mollified, was extreamly deſirous to improve ſo happy a beginning by a ſuitable pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs to an intire pacification. But though ſhe ſaw him much troubled and very penitent, ſhe gave him not the comfort of a kind expreſſion or look, but againſt her inclination forced her ſelf to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear harſh, and act the cruel againſt him. <hi>Aſſen,</hi> who thought one night at leaſt neceſſary to be afforded <hi>Laura,</hi> to diſpoſe her ſelf for an intire Reconciliation; and that being upon the point of
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:60459:258"/>
executing ſo hazardous a deſign, care ſhould be had to take their meaſures aright, asked the <hi>Aga</hi> whether he thought it not fit to retire, leſt being ſeen to come from <hi>Laura</hi> ſo late, he might give cauſe of ſuſpicion. The <hi>Aga</hi> anſwered, he need fear nothing, the <hi>Dey</hi> having given him full pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to ſtay as long as he pleaſed. But <hi>Laura,</hi> who had more reaſon to be of <hi>Aſſen</hi>'s than of the <hi>Aga</hi>'s opinion, who was wholly led by his paſſion, ſpoke to him, though ſomewhat againſt her will, to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw. The <hi>Aga</hi> ready to obey this order, begged the favour of her to give him hopes at leaſt, ſhe would pardon him, if he made it appear he was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together innocent as to the matter of <hi>Alphonſo,</hi> and that her hatred of him ſhould be at an end. She made him no anſwer, but her eyes betrayed her heart; and ſpoke clearer in his favour than her voice could have done, <hi>Beyran</hi> kiſſed one of her hands, which ſhe could not refuſe him, and left her full of that evenings adventures which found her entertainment. The reſt of that night not knowing what to think of <hi>Beyran</hi>'s fortune, whom ſhe believed turned Turk for deſpair; at the thought of this, the tears trickled down her Cheeks, and ſhe perceived, that if what he told her was true, of her having been betrayed by her Maid, and that he had not any hand in <hi>Alphonſo</hi>'s baſe action, as in truth it was ſcarce credible he had, ſhe would love him more than ever, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don his being found with the Vice Queen, though this was a tender point, and not to be remembred without a volly of ſighs.</p>

There was no reſiſting</hi> Eleanors <hi>charms, and I had inſtantly taken the reſolution to love her, had not the Vice Queen uſed all poſſible arts to divert me; ſhe expreſs'd no ſmall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaiſance for me, which I attributed to the friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip between her Son and me.</hi> But having
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:60459:259"/>
found me one day in deep meditation, ſhe asked me, <hi>whether I would freely acknowledge the cauſe of my melancholy; if ſhe could gueſs what it was, and might ſerve me in the buſineſs?</hi> I aſſur'd her I would; ſhe adds, <hi>I was under the Fate of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other unfortunate Lovers, who could not ſee</hi> Eleanor, <hi>without being affected with the excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of her Beauty.</hi> I was ſtrangely ſurpriz'd, to find a paſſion ſcarce entertained in my Soul, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready known to the Vice Queen, and could not imagine how ſhe came by the diſcovery of a ſecret, I had reſolved to keep cloſe as long as poſſibly I could: it was not in my power to deny it; the trouble in my face and change of my colour, having given her ſufficient evidence, how truly ſhe had gueſſed. I told her I found my ſelf too weak to reſiſt the Charms of that beautiful Maid, and was ſorry only <hi>Don Alphonſo</hi> her Son, and my Friend was concern'd: ſhe anſwered, that a paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on we cannot maſter, was not to be complain'd of, nor blam'd, and that her Son could not be ſo unreaſonable, as not to pardon my falling into a diſtemper, himſelf had been afflicted with. But ſhe believed, I ſhould prove as unfortunate as her Son; but to keep her word with me, ſhe would let me ſee, my concerns were more dear to her than the Intereſt of her Son; but I muſt not blame her, if her endeavours ſhould prove ineffectual, which ſhe had too much cauſe to expect, from the ſtrange and unparallel'd inſenſibility of that fair Maid, that ſhe would ſpeak for me that very day, and ſee what hopes of a favourable reception, and whether ſhe defi'd love, out of a general averſion for Mankind, or a particular diſguſt againſt ſome of that Sex. The ſame time ſhe aſſigned me Ten
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:60459:259"/>
a Clock at night, to meet her in the great Walk in the Garden, to receive an account of her Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiation: I was there to wait for her, and ſhe keept her Aſſignation. I ſaw her come with one of her Maids, who was her Confident; and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing given her my hand to lead her into a Bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, I went in with her trembling, for fear of hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ill News, which I preſently apprehended from her Countenance. Poor <hi>Marqueſs,</hi> ſays ſhe, <hi>you have no better fortune than others; this Girls heart is proof to all Eſſays; and did you but know that ill-favoured deſcription and ſcurvy character ſhe gave of you, you would ſoon judge it to no purpoſe to apply your ſelf to her: but I would have you believe, I ſay not this to diſcourage you, but ſhould be ſorry to ſee a young Gentleman as you, having qualities worthy the eſteem of a fair Lady, ſhould imploy them where there is not any hopes to prevail.</hi> I had certainly ſuſpected this extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary condeſcenſion, and goodneſs of the Vice-Queen, had not what ſhe ſaid been agreeable to the report of the whole Court, that the fair <hi>Elea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor</hi> was the moſt inſenſible perſon in the World. I knew well enough, 'twas not any concern ſhe had for the Paſſion of her Son, made her ſpeak as ſhe did; ſhe loved him very little, and the complaiſance ſhe had expreſs'd for me, ſecured me on that ſide. I might have been ſo ſagacious and quick-ſighted, as to ſee ſhe ſpoke for her ſelf, and adviſed me to quit the thoughts of <hi>Eleanor,</hi> to gain her ſelf Advantage; but I was ſo oppreſt with grief at the News, that I was utterly inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of making any reflection: ſhe was a Lady, the moſt dexterous and inſinuating on Earth, and made ſo good uſe of the power ſhe had over
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:60459:260"/>
me, that ſhe not only ſhook the paſſion I was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, but help'd me to take reſolution to rid my ſelf of it, though with the loſs of my life. To bring this about, I thought it neceſſary to find another Beauty to amuſe my Affections; but where ever I caſt my eyes, in the Court, or out of it, could diſcover nothing capable to make me forget one moment, the Charms of the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful <hi>Eleanor.</hi> The Vice Queen having after that evening ſaid nothing to me of it, ſaw me one morning alone in her Chamber, where her Son had newly left me; ſhe asked me ſmiling, <hi>Whether I had taken her advice; and followed her Counſels?</hi> Madam, <hi>anſwered I,</hi> that cannot be done without my having equal command over my Affections, as you have over yours; or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="165" facs="tcp:60459:260"/>
trouble to find me a Miſtreſs. She told me, ſhe took delight in't; that ſhe was loth any ones Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections ſhould be loſt for want of being engag'd; and that knowing my merit, ſhe would think it a pleaſure to ſerve me, and take care I wanted no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in her Court.</p>
                  <p>All this ſhe ſaid with an air ſo free, ſo full of goodneſs, it charm d me: And I had almoſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, She might without further ſearch, find in her ſelf what ſhe promiſed me elſewhere. The truth is, ſetting aſide her Age, ſhe might have paſs'd for one of the faireſt and beſt humoured Women of the Kingdom; but I was not willing to venture ſo far for fear of miſcarriage, and was content to wait for a ſight of her, ſhe would provide for me. I deſired her not to make me languiſh, being an impatient Lover, and in a condition required pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent remedy. She aſſur'd me, I ſhould hear from her that day, and that I had no more to do, but prepare my ſelf to be deeply in Love.</p>
                  <p>At this we were interrupted by company com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in, which oblig d me to withdraw I ſpent the reſt of the morning in muſing of what paſs'd between us, gueſſing ſometimes ſhe meant one Lady, ſometimes another of thoſe I knew moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate with her, and moſt proper for the deſign, but could not fix my judgment on any. This gave me ſome diſquiet and trouble, with an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient deſire to ſee the Vice-Queen again. I made in the afternoon forty journeys to Court, to ſee if ſhe had any thing to ſay to me; ſhe laughed at my haſte, and at length told me, my hour was not yet come, nor the day gone; that I ſhould go home and have patience, and when the time came, ſhe would ſend me news. Night came, but no
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:60459:261"/>
news from the Vice-Queen, which made me be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, ſhe fool'd me; ſo that I could not forbear returning to the Palace, where I heard ſhe was gone to viſit a Lady her Friend. I was ſo ready to imagine it was the Lady ſhe ſpoke of, that I enquired her name, and where ſhe lived; but could not learn either. The caution ſhe had uſed in that particular, fully convinc'd me, ſhe was gone about my buſineſs, and that ſhe made the viſit private, that my love might be as ſecret, and the Court kept ignorant, how far her complaiſance had carried her to ſerve me.</p>
                  <p>I return'd in all haſte to my Lodging, as aſſur'd of all this; nor was I much miſtaken, for I was ſcarce got thither, but I received from her a Billet, brought me by a Lady attended with two Chairs, and expreſs'd as follows.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I have done what you deſired, and I think, found out the perſon you wanted; you will eaſily confeſs I am very much your friend: the ſole acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment I expect is, you would not make me a Lyar, having promiſed the Lady that upon the bare deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion I made you of her, you would bring her a heart full of love. See you do it, for if you deceive me in this, I ſhall never pardon you the fault. You have no more to do but follow her that brings you this Billet, without noiſe or attendance; for you are to come into a place of ſafety.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Had it come from any other, I ſhould not have gone without a Guard at diſtance, but coming from the Vice-Queen, I could not ſuſpect danger. All I thought of it was, that being a jovial and pleaſant Lady, ſhe had a frollick in her head, and reſolved to put on me ſome pleaſant trick: without more ado, I made me ready to laugh with her in good
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:60459:261"/>
earneſt: I went into one of the Chairs, and follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her who brought the Billet, and was got into the other. They carried us a great way into a private part of the Town, and there ſet down the Chairs, which my Guide ſent away, and we marchcd a little further, till we came to a houſe which made a fair ſhew; I learnt afterwards it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long'd to a Lady of her Bed-Chamber, her Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, who indeed was my Guide, and having open'd the door, made me go in without noiſe: I ſaw neither Lacquey nor light This ſurpriz'd me, and made me the more confident, ſome frollick intended: I ſaid not a word, but prepar'd, in caſe things went not as I could wiſh, to have my ſhare of the mirth with them, who came to laugh at my coſt. At laſt the Lady took me by the hand to lead me up a pair of ſtairs in the dark, which brought us to a room no lighter than the ſtairs, and thence into a Chamber where were two Flam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boys lighted. It appeared a good room, but what pleaſed me moſt was, the ſight of a fair Lady, who careleſy laid on a very rich bed, ſeemed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſleep with her hood over her face. I began to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent my cenſure of the Vice-Queen, whom I then thought to have written in good earneſt: I ſaw nothing in this Lady but what pleaſed me extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and to ſpeak the truth, it was the ſole moment I may be ſaid to have forgot the fair <hi>Eleanor,</hi> ſince I loved her. She was in a looſe dreſs, but hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom, and rich beyond expreſſion: I had not ſeen the like at Court, and knew not what to think, the Richneſs of the furniture, as well as her dreſs declaring her to be a Lady of no ordinary quality: but I was very much perplext to gueſs who ſhe was. I made up to her, and ſpoke; and the
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:60459:262"/>
amorous impatience I had to know her not permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the uſe of much Ceremony towards the Lady that ſtay'd for me, I put my knee to the Ground, and laying hold on one of her fair hands, which ſhe allowed me to kiſs; It was but reaſon, <hi>Madam,</hi> ſaid I, <hi>I ſhould have languiſhed all this day as I have done, who could not expect this happineſs, without being put to the pain at leaſt of longing for it.</hi> I looked for an anſwer, in hopes to know the voice, but ſhe ſaid not a word. I intreated her to eaſe me of the pain, ſhe might believe I was in, and that if ſhe reſolved not to be ſeen, ſhe would how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever vouchſafe to ſpeak to me, that where I was directed to bring a heart of love, I hoped to ſee a Lady that had Beauty and Wit; that as yet ſhe had only moved my curioſity, but if ſhe meant to reach my heart, I muſt ſee her. As I ſpoke thus, I perceived her laugh, which gave me the boldneſs to lift up her hood: She put back my hand, but ſo weakly, I thought it would not diſpleaſe her to preſs a little further: there were but we two in the Room, her Confident having doubtleſs received Orders to withdraw, and I was ready to put her to the ſqueak, when at laſt ſhe threw off her hood. But how was I ſurpriz d to ſee 'twas the Vice-Queen. Well <hi>Sir,</hi> ſays ſhe, bluſhing, <hi>will you be content with your good fortune? And will it not be preſumption in me to fancy my ſelf capable to make you forget all other Beauties.</hi> I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered her more like a Gallant than a Lover: ſhe was ſatisfi'd however, and without ingaging further in the relation of a diſcourſe, of which you may gueſs the conſequence, I will tell you only that having ſpent two or three hours in her company,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:60459:262"/>
I return'd to my lodging the way I came, and ſhe to the Palace.</p>
                  <p>I ſaw her on the morrow, and our Correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence held for ſome time, but cur'd not my paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Her Son with whom I had particular as well as general reaſons to maintain a fair Correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, expreſt more friendſhip for me than I could have wiſht: he was not content to make me the Confident of his affection, but imploy'd me to ſpeak for him to the fair <hi>Eleanor,</hi> expecting more benefit from the Interceſſion of ſuch a Friend, than any addreſſes of his own: I did, and you have doubtleſs heard from her; ſhe let me underſtand, I ſhould ſpeed better in ſpeaking for my ſelf than for him, 'twas then I thought my ſelf the moſt unfortunate of men, for believing ſo eaſily what the Vice-Queen had ſaid to me, whoſe conduct convinc'd me ſufficiently, how far ſhe concern'd her ſelf in my buſineſs. I deſign'd that moment to abandon her favour, and give my ſelf up intire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to my firſt paſſion; but to prevent the trouble I might expect from the Vice Queen, if ſhe knew it, I thought fit to diſſemble a little, and diſingage my ſelf by degrees, without declaring on the ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den for <hi>Eleanor.</hi> I obſerved the beſt I could the meaſures I had taken, but 'tis a difficult matter to conceal a paſſion from a jealous and a witty Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. The Vice-Queen perceived my relapſe, before I made <hi>Eleanor</hi> acquainted with it; ſhe puniſhed my Apoſtacy with a thouſand reproaches, which were ſeconded with tears, and I (the better to manage her) pretended a firm Re-ingagement to her. But what will not a ſlighted Lady do? or what more dangerous than a jealous Woman? I was thenceforward more curious of ſeeing and
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:60459:263"/>
ſpeaking with the beautiful <hi>Eleanor,</hi> and avoided the occaſions of being found in her company, while the Vice-Queen was by, but all to no purpoſe: the Vice-Queen knew all, and ſo well diſcern'd what was true, from what was feigned, that ſhe gueſſed exactly right of the privateſt of my thoughts. One day as I walked with her in the Garden, ſhe told me, we had both loſt time to no purpoſe, I inforceing my ſelf againſt my Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, to pretend continuance of affection for her, and ſhe endeavouring to make me love, though againſt my will: That ſhe ſaw well enough what I now did, was but the effect of my civility to a Lady of her quality, who had expreſt kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for me. But 'twas time to put an end to our pain, and to ſatisfie me ſhe intended it; ſhe aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red me, ſhe would no longer oppoſe my Inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and that I would believe it, upon the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion ſhe made me, that I might expect from <hi>Eleanor</hi> not only a kind reception, but ſomething of love; yet I put no great confidence in all theſe good words, as coming from a party too lyable to ſuſpicion: But when by an Exceſs of goodneſs ſhe added, that to convince me, ſhe was more my Friend than I could imagine, ſhe would contribute more than any other to my ſatisfaction; and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure a Letter from the Viceroy to <hi>Eleanor</hi>'s Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to perſwade him to conſent I ſhould have his Daughter. I was ſo tranſported with joy, I could not forbear making her very large acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. She told me, I ſhould ſee by the anſwer to that Letter what good Service ſhe had done me: She did as ſhe promiſed, and after the Letter ſhe procured from the Viceroy, I doubted not of being compleatly happy in few days. The news
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:60459:263"/>
was confirmed by the beautiful <hi>Eleanor,</hi> and I had the pleaſure to ſee her glad of it as I was: nothing troubled me then but the ſlow pace of time. The Viceroy had ſent an expreſs to <hi>Genes,</hi> but the Courier was ſcarce got a Horſe-back, but I wiſh'd him return'd: every moment ſeemed a year by my longing and impatience: the only pleaſure I had, was the time I was in <hi>Eleanor</hi>'s company, who aſſur'd on her part of the ſucceſs of the Viceroy's Recommendation, who had great Intereſt with her Father, and ſenſible of the pain I was in to have the matter confirmed; had not the power to deny my paſſion the favour of a viſit, which I begged I might make her, having engag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my ſelf to her with all the promiſes and oaths, to be expected on ſuch an occaſion from a Lover belov'd. The aſſignation was made, and her Chamber agreed for the place of Rendezvous. <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don me, my dear</hi> Aſſen, <hi>for fetching a ſigh at the remembrance of that day, which ſhould have been a time of love and of joy, but was the moſt diſmal and unfortunate of my life.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Night was come, and when I thought my ſelf juſt ready to be poſſeſs'd of ſo great a happineſs, <hi>Clarice,</hi> who waited on <hi>Eleanor</hi> in her Chamber, and was her intimate Confident, brought me a Billet, I will ſhew you, having by good fortune kept it ſafe to this minute. With that he took out a little Purſe from his pocket, and out of the Purſe the Billet, which he read to <hi>Aſſen</hi> in theſe words.</p>

                  <p>I had never received a Letter from <hi>Eleanor,</hi> nor knew her Character; ſo that it was eaſie for <hi>Clarice</hi> to make me believe that Billet came from her: I asked her what her Miſtreſs ail'd; <hi>Nothing,</hi> ſays ſhe laughing, <hi>but that ſhe is not very well this evening.</hi> I fancied! underſtood her meaning, and examin'd her no further; but withdrew ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſpleaſed with my ill fortune that night, when a Page of the Vice-Queens met me coming down ſtairs, and told me, his Lady deſired to ſpeak with me. In the humour I was in, I could have wiſh'd a Diſpenſation from waiting upon her; but not knowing what excuſe to make, being ſo near her, and fearing ſhe might have ſomething to tell me from <hi>Eleanor,</hi> being the common ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of her diſcourſe with me, I followed the Page into her Chamber, where I found her expecting my coming: ſhe was at her Toilet, and the Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roy being out of Town, as ſoon as ſhe ſaw me, ſhe reproached me for deſerting her ſo, ſhe could of late ſcarce ſee me in the croud; that if <hi>I</hi> would not out of Gallantry, <hi>I</hi> ſhould at leaſt out of civili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty have afforded her my company, when deſtitute of other. <hi>I</hi> was not diſpoſed for giving her ſo pleaſing an anſwer as <hi>I</hi> would have done another time, however <hi>I</hi> ſaid not any thing to diſoblige her: <hi>I</hi> was melancholy and vext, but ſo deeply in love, <hi>I</hi> had a ſtock of kindneſs, and complaiſance which abundantly furniſhed me with pleaſing ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, which the Vice-Queen did not diſapprove of: <hi>I</hi> had not ſeen her in a better humour; and falling into diſcourſe, ſhe kept me with her a great part of that night; but ſhe thought me out
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:60459:264"/>
of humour, and quarrelled with me upon't: <hi>I</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed my ſelf, as having ſat up all the night before at play. Hereupon ſhe invited me to lye on her Bed; <hi>I</hi> was priviledg'd to be familiar, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out further intreaty made uſe of my liberty: for the truth is, <hi>I</hi> was almoſt dead for want of ſleep; within leſs than two hours <hi>I</hi> was awak'd on the ſudden by the light of a Flamboy, held before my eyes, and the firſt object <hi>I</hi> ſaw, was <hi>Eleanor</hi> with a Ponyard in her hand, to take away my life, had not <hi>Don Alphonſo</hi> laid hold on her arm, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented the ſtroke. Judge you what amazement <hi>I</hi> was in, I might with ſome reaſon have ſuſpected all this a Dream: But my Rival having ſeized the Ponyard, to execute what he had hindered <hi>Eleanor</hi> to do, had ſhe not done me in her turn the like Service. <hi>I</hi> thought it high time to take care of my life, and running to my Arms, put my ſelf in a poſture of defence. The Vice-Queen half dead with the fright, came running to part us, but was like to have been kill'd by her Son, who ſeemed as eager to diſpatch her as me: <hi>I</hi> happily ſaved her two or three times, and at laſt ſtanding before her, the fury <hi>Don Alphonſo</hi> was in, made him run on my Weapon, and kill himſelf rather than be killed by me: <hi>I</hi> ſaw him fall, which troubled me extreamly, foreſeeing the dreadful Conſequence of ſuch a misfortune. <hi>I</hi> turn'd towards the unhappy Mother, to ask her what ſhe would do, and found her ſwouned away, and lying without motion: <hi>I</hi> was ſo much afflicted with the ſpectacle, <hi>I</hi> wiſh'd my ſelf dead: at laſt neceſſity preſſing me to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw, <hi>I</hi> entred <hi>Eleanor</hi>'s Chamber, to ſee her once more, and dye at her feet, if ſhe deſired my life to expiate my fault, but <hi>I</hi> found her not, and ſo left

                     <hi>Clarice</hi> was very ill in the <hi>Felucca,</hi> of the fright ſhe had taken, or elſe Sea-ſick. <hi>I</hi> had not ſeen her all the time of the diſaſter at <hi>Naples, I</hi> told her part of the ſtory, and found it ſo much afflicted her; eſpecially when <hi>I</hi> acquainted her with the death of <hi>Alphonſo,</hi> ſhe grew worſe and worſe: <hi>I</hi> asked her ſeveral queſtions, which ſhe anſwered with a great deal of trouble, pretending Ignorance, but in ſuch a manner as gave me cauſe enough to ſuſpectned the contrary, and believe ſhe was more concer in this buſineſs than <hi>I</hi> was aware of: <hi>I</hi> was unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to preſs her in the condition ſhe was in, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal the ſecret, though <hi>I</hi> was curious of a diſcovery, but hoped to make it, when ſhe ſhould be a little better.</p>
                  <p>We arriv'd at <hi>Barcellona,</hi> but no news of the Bark <hi>Eleanor</hi> went aboard of: <hi>I</hi> reſolved to have patience a while, as well as the Merchants, who had effects in it of great value: But how careful ſoever <hi>I</hi> was of <hi>Clarice,</hi> ſhe grew worſe than at Sea, and all the Phyſicians could do for her, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented not her being reduced to that extremity, they gave her over as deſperate; ſo that finding her ſelf at deaths door, ſhe ſent for me to her Chamber, and having deſired to ſpeak with me in private, the reſt of the company quitted the Room, and ſhe told me, that <hi>Don Alphonſo</hi> hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing gained her, ſhe did him all the Service ſhe could againſt me with her Miſtreſs; and having over-heard part of my laſt diſcourſe with <hi>Eleanor,</hi> ſhe inſtantly acquainted my Rival with it, who
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:60459:266"/>
tranſported with rage and deſpair, againſt a deſign ſo fatal to his Affection, reſolved by any means to defeat it, and if poſſible make advantage of it for himſelf. That in order to this, he made her write a Letter, and carry it me, as from her Miſtreſs; that <hi>Don Alphonſo</hi> took his time, and his meaſures accordingly; having learnt from her the hour, and the manner of my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Eleanor</hi>'s Chamber; that he got in with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out difficulty: but what paſs'd further, ſhe knew not; only ſome hours after, hearing the noiſe of Swords, ſhe ran in, where ſhe found her Miſtreſs all in diſorder, packing away; that ſhe would have followed her, but her Miſtreſs begg'd of her to let her go alone. At laſt finding the noiſe increaſe in the Vice-Queens Chamber, ſhe was frighted, and went towards the Port, where <hi>I</hi> found her; with that the unhappy Girl with abundance of tears, begged that now at her death, <hi>I</hi> would pardon her a Crime had coſt her her life. She ſaid no more, but two hours after died: <hi>I</hi> will not tell you the different motions of my heart, during the diſmal Relation this Wretch made me; but the appearance of Death in her face made me pardon her. As for <hi>Don Alphon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, I</hi> heartily wiſh'd him alive again, as not ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently puniſhed by one death for his Treaſon; but the Traytors being both in another World, I had no Subject to exerciſe my Revenge on, unleſs my ill Fate, againſt which <hi>I</hi> ſpent my time in fruitleſs Complaints.</p>
                  <p>To Compleat my miſery, News came, the Bark we expected was loſt, which was confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Advice from ſeveral Parties. Never man in ſuch deſpair as <hi>I; I</hi> will not tell you the
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:60459:266"/>
extravagancies it made me run into; it diſtracts me to think on't: there was no other remedy to bring me to my ſelf, but to perſwade me the News from Sea were not ſo ſure, but that we had reaſon to expect further Confirmation, and that Veſſels reported caſt away, came fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently ſafe into Port: that the Sea was a large Countrey, and one Veſſel might be ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily miſtaken for another, and that many fell into the hands of the <hi>Turks,</hi> which were ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to have been wracked, becauſe they were not heard of. This gave me but ſmall comfort; yet <hi>I</hi> thought <hi>I</hi> had ſome reaſon of hope, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking a Voyage to viſit all the Ports of the <hi>Levant,</hi> till <hi>I</hi> ſhould learn ſome certainty of the <hi>Felucca I</hi> was in ſearch of.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Aga</hi> having finiſhed his Story, <hi>Aſſen</hi> told him, he was very glad for his ſake, that Matters paſs'd otherwiſe than <hi>Eleanor</hi> believed; that it would be no hard matter to make his peace, when ſhe underſtood the Treachery of her Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber-maid; that he was not to wonder at the Anger ſhe expreſs'd againſt him, for that ſhe knew not any of the Particulars he related to juſtifie himſelf, but ſuſpected him of Intelligence with <hi>Don Alphonſo</hi> to betray her. <hi>Heavens! is it poſſible,</hi> cries Hippolito, <hi>ſhe ſhould do my Love the injury, to entertain ſuch a thought of me! had I not loved her as I did, could ſhe fancy me capable of ſo much baſeneſs?</hi> Sir, ſaid <hi>Aſſen,</hi> when there's Evidence againſt us, and no Plea in defence for our juſtification, we are eaſily caſt: what could you expect a Lady diſhonoured by the Son, ſhould have believed of
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:60459:267"/>
you, whom ſhe found in the Arms of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but that he ſacrificed the one to you, that you might leave him the other. <hi>Ah!</hi> Aſſen, replies the <hi>Aga</hi> with a ſigh, <hi>let's talk no more of what's paſt; as innocent as I am of the one ſide, I muſt acknowledge my ſelf guilty of the other.</hi> But let me entreat you to excuſe and extenuate the fault as much as you can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore her; or rather never ſpeak of it, but en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour only to diſabuſe her, and alter the ill opinion ſhe hath of me, and aſſure your ſelf, what-ever Fortune befal me, <hi>I</hi> will not be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful for the Service you will do me. <hi>I</hi> believe you have heard from her who <hi>I</hi> am, and if the condition ſhe is in, or any other Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, hath oblig'd her to conceal her Birth, and other things concerning her, that might ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der her more worthy the zeal you have for her Service, <hi>I</hi> will ſatisfie your curioſity in every particular. <hi>Aſſen</hi> thanked him, and fell a laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and anſwered, he had known her too long to want Inſtructions in thoſe Particulars, and could give a better account of her Birth and Family than any Perſon what-ever. The <hi>Aga,</hi> ſurpriz'd at it, entreated him earneſtly to let him underſtand, how he being a <hi>Turk,</hi> ſhould ſo long and ſo particularly know her. <hi>Aſſen</hi> told him the Story, and part of what happen'd at <hi>Genes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It was day by that time <hi>Aſſen</hi> had done, which put them in mind of taking ſome reſolution a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the deſign in hand, and the means to be made uſe of, to get <hi>Laura</hi> out of the Caſtle without danger. They thought of ſeveral ways,
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:60459:267"/>
but all appear'd full of uncertainty and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience; yet they two could beſt do it of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, the one having all the power over <hi>Laura</hi>'s Guards, and the other over the Garriſon of the Caſtle. But all things were ſo ſtrictly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined by the vigilance of the inferior Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, whom the <hi>Dey</hi> (a man as vigilant as fearful) had ſtrictly commanded to be always on Guard, and not permit any to come in, or go out, without taking exact notice of them, that it was abſolutely neceſſary to take right meaſures, and ſtill fear the ſucceſs. <hi>Aſſen</hi> at length bethought himſelf of a Stratagem, the leſs ſubject to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery, as covered under a cloak of Religion, though in truth, apt to ſtartle a nice Girl as <hi>Laura.</hi> There was a Souldier of the Caſtle dead the night afore, to be buried that day; he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to lock up the Corps in a Chamber, and carry out <hi>Laura</hi> on the Bier, as if ſhe had been the Souldier, to be buried in the Church-yard behind the Caſtle. The <hi>Aga</hi> was of opinion, there could be no danger in the expedient, but doubted much whether <hi>Laura</hi> could be induc'd to make uſe of it; yet after long conſultation, and diſcourſe of other means, they thought that not only the beſt, but the only one they could promiſe themſelves a good deſign from. But to prevent the trouble <hi>Laura</hi> might have upon the apprehenſion of Death, or other ſad Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, they agreed not to tell her of the Bier, but propoſe carrying her out in a Chair. This being reſolved on, <hi>Aſſen,</hi> who was to ſee her that morning, undertook to perſwade her to it, and the <hi>Aga</hi> in the mean time gave order, the dead Souldier ſhould not be buried till the
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:60459:268"/>
Evening. He recommended to <hi>Aſſen,</hi> the care of his Affairs with his Miſtreſs, gave him <hi>Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rices</hi> Letter to produce in juſtification of him; and after a great deal of Civility and Kindneſs on both ſides, they parted, to meet again at Din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner at <hi>Aſſen</hi>'s, for fear their long Conferences in the Caſtle might occaſion ſuſpicion in the Garriſon, being extreamly jealous and miſtruſtful. <hi>Laura,</hi> who had ſcarce reſted all night for Dreams, which troubled her, was very joyful to ſee <hi>Aſſen</hi> come ſo early, to divert her from the thoughts of them. <hi>Well, dear</hi> Aſſen, ſays ſhe, <hi>ſhall we be once eaſed of our Chains? and muſt we car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry this Traytor along with us?</hi> Traytor, <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> anſwers <hi>Aſſen,</hi> he is the moſt honeſt and moſt paſſionate of Lovers. <hi>Ah!</hi> ſays ſhe, <hi>I foreſaw he would corrupt even your fidelity; I know too well the power he hath to gain affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and had reaſon enough to diſtruſt him.</hi> Be not ſo haſty, <hi>Madam, replies the Turk,</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn a man unheard. Why, <hi>what ſays ſhe,</hi> can he offer againſt what what I have ſeen? Did not I find him with the Vice-Queen? Was it not he that help'd the Traytor <hi>Alphonſo</hi> to abuſe me? No, <hi>Madam,</hi> I aſſure you, <hi>anſwers Aſſen,</hi> be pleaſed to let me tell you, what you know well enough, that he loved you too well, to be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of an action of that kind; and to clear all your doubts, <hi>adds he,</hi> ſhewing her <hi>Clarices</hi> Letter, Know you that Character? <hi>Well,</hi> ſaid ſhe, ſomewhat ſurpriz d, <hi>'tis my Chamber-maids: Read it,</hi> replies <hi>Aſſen,</hi> and you ſhall ſee who was guilty of the Treaſon. <hi>Laura</hi> read it, and had ſearce done, when relenting at the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury done <hi>Hippolito,</hi> or troubled for the Treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:60459:268"/>
of a Maid, ſhe had ſo much confided in; <hi>O God of Vengeance,</hi> cry'd ſhe with tears, <hi>wilt thou leave unpuniſhed a Wretch ſo treacherous, and one who bath been the cauſe of ſo many diſaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers?</hi> No ſure, <hi>ſays Aſſen,</hi> for ſhe is already dead, if not as her Treaſon deſerved, yet for grief of having committed it. With that he related to her, what ſhe knew not of the Story of the <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs,</hi> and found it no difficult buſineſs to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſe the great wrath ſhe had expreſs'd againſt him, to procure him her general pardon, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain her conſent for his going along with them. <hi>Aſſen,</hi> like a dexterous Confident, ſaid not a word of what concerned the Vice-Queen; and <hi>Laura,</hi> who had no deſire to be any more an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry with her dear Servant, was not very curious to queſtion him on that point: ſhe was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to believe him innocent of one ſide, and to be furniſhed with a pretence not to hate him; ſo hard a matter is it to uſe ill thoſe we love, how criminal ſoever. <hi>Aſſen</hi> then told her of the reſolution taken by the <hi>Aga</hi> and him, to have her carried out in a Chair, and found her diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to do what-ever they ſhould think fit, but with condition there ſhould be no more danger for them than for her. <hi>Aſſen</hi> undertook it, and told her, ſhe had no more to do, but make ready againſt the firſt Watch, whilſt the <hi>Aga</hi> and he took Oorders for other things. <hi>Aſſen</hi> went home, where <hi>Beyran-Aga</hi> came ſhortly after, and gave him an account of all he had done. <hi>Aſſen</hi> laboured with much dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence and dexterity to ſee the <hi>Brigandine</hi> well ſtored with Neceſſaries; you may believe, <hi>Bey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran</hi> failed not, as buſie as he was, to deſire an
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:60459:269"/>
account of what moſt concerned him, the ſtate of his Affair with his Miſtreſs. His dear Confident Acquainted him with what ſucceſs he had diſcharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Commiſſion he gave him, which <hi>Beyran</hi> was ſo gald of, as it was not his power to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs his Acknowledgment. All was ready, and <hi>Aſſen</hi> had given out the neceſſary Orders, as well for the <hi>Brigandine,</hi> as for Horſes and Men. The <hi>Aga</hi> and he went together to the Caſtle, where the <hi>Aga</hi> made him a Preſent of all the Jewels he had received at ſeveral times from the <hi>Dey,</hi> and entreated him to accept them not as a ſatisfaction, but a pledge of the aſſurance he had given him to be ever his Friend, and ſerve him on all occaſions. <hi>Aſſen,</hi> who endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured, but in vain, to refuſe his liberality, would not accept of it, but on condition the <hi>Aga</hi> would make uſe on all occaſions of what he had beſtowed, as ſtill his own, and believe <hi>Aſſen</hi> ſenſible, he had not ſufficiently obliged him to merit ſo rich a Preſent. They went From the Caſtle, to make their Court to the <hi>Dey;</hi> and the hour being come, <hi>Aſſen</hi> firſt changed <hi>Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra</hi>'s Guards, relieving them by three of his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, whom he was to take with him, that none might be left behind to diſcover the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, or the Road they ſhould take. The <hi>Aga</hi> quickly followed him, longing to ſee <hi>Laura;</hi> he fell down at her feet in ſuch a Tranſport of Joy and Love, it moved to that tenderneſs, ſhe could not forbear embracing him. As ſhe raiſed him from the Ground, they were falling into amorous Diſcourſe; but <hi>Aſſen</hi> told them, it was not a time to diſcourſe, but to put their Deſign in execution, unleſs they had a mind to
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:60459:269"/>
ſee it miſcarry; and that when they ſhould be once out of danger, they ſhould have leiſure enough to ſay what they pleaſed. <hi>Laura</hi> and <hi>Beyran,</hi> who deſired nothing more than to ſee themſelves at liberty, were eaſily perſwaded to follow his Advice. And the Chair being brought by the <hi>Aga</hi>'s Order, who had hidden the Corps, they wrapt up <hi>Laura</hi> in a clean Sheet, and without ſaying a word of the Bier, put her in it, and cauſed it to be carried out of her Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, where having according to the cuſtom of the Place, thrown a Carpet over her, one of <hi>Aſſen</hi>'s men took the Lanthorn, and the other two carried the Bier; <hi>Beyran</hi> leading the Van, and <hi>Aſſen</hi> bringing up the Rear. A Corps is a ſacred thing among the <hi>Turks;</hi> nor would any of the Guard have thought of ſearching the Bier, though neither <hi>Beyran</hi> nor <hi>Aſſen</hi> had been with it. They went to the Church-yard, where having taken <hi>Laura</hi> out of her Grave, they mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched towards the <hi>Carthage-gate,</hi> which the <hi>Aga</hi> commanded to be opened, that they might take Horſe, which attended them hard by <hi>Laura</hi> and the <hi>Aga,</hi> whom we will hereafter call by their names, could not yet take any pleaſure to ſee themſelves out of the Caſtle and City, for fear of ill Accidents, but long'd to ſee themſelves at Sea; however they were glad they got happily ſo far, in hopes Fortune would in favour of Love, improve that lucky beginning to a ſuitable end. But this ſmall Lightning of Joy quickly vaniſhed, being daſh'd out by the cruelty of their Fate; for being arriv'd, where they expected to take Horſe, they found by <hi>Aſſen</hi>'s Servants, the <hi>Baſſa</hi>'s Sophies had taken them away. In what perplexity then was this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:60459:270"/>
Company? they were five or ſix Leagues diſtant from the Cape of <hi>Carthage,</hi> where the <hi>Brigandine</hi> was; they had no time to loſe, and knew not what to reſolve on, when on the ſudden they heard the noiſe of Horſes mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing towards them. <hi>Aſſen</hi> hid <hi>Eleanor</hi> and <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polito</hi> under an old Wall, and advanced with ſome of his people towards the Horſe-men: They marched apace, and quickly asked, who is there? <hi>Aſſen</hi> told them who he was, and by good fortune, found it was <hi>Romadan,</hi> the Maſter of the Gallies, coming from <hi>Port-farm</hi> with a Guard. He told him, the <hi>Baſſa</hi>'s Sophies had taken from his people ſome Horſes he had in readineſs to go for <hi>Cape-Carthage,</hi> to ſee a <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gandine</hi> he was ſending out to Sea. <hi>Romadan,</hi> who knew the reſpect the <hi>Baſſa</hi> had for <hi>Aſſen,</hi> was angry for what was done by the Sophies; and to remedy the inconvenience, told <hi>Aſſen,</hi> he might take his choice of what Horſes he pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of his Troop, and not trouble himſelf for his own, they ſhould be ſent him where he pleaſed to order. <hi>Aſſen,</hi> glad of the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity, accepted his offer; and <hi>Romadan</hi> taking him aſide, told him, The <hi>Baſſa</hi> had a deſign to come again to him, and by any means to get <hi>Laura</hi> out of the Caſtle, and that he would do well in his return from <hi>Cape-Carthage,</hi> to take the Camp in his way, and endeavour to divert the <hi>Baſſa</hi> from ſo dangerous an Enterprize. <hi>Aſſen</hi> having promiſed it, diſ-engaged himſelf from <hi>Romadan</hi> as ſoon as he could; but <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madan</hi> would oblige him at parting, with two of his Horſe-men, to accompany him, and ſerve him from the Parties that were abroad, and
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:60459:270"/>
might ſet upon him unknown. This put <hi>Aſſen</hi> into a little perplexity, but he would not refuſe the kindneſs, for fear of giving cauſe of ſuſpicion: And having taken his leave, he advanced to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his company, and acquainted the two Lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in few words, what fortune he had met with. All mounted, and <hi>Eleanor</hi> in Boys Cloaths, paſs'd for a young Slave of <hi>Aſſen</hi>'s, the night helping to cover the diſguiſe, they made all the haſte poſſible, <hi>Hippolito</hi> being ſtill at <hi>Eleanor</hi>'s elbow, the Maſter of the Gallies Horſe-men led the Van, to anſwer thoſe they met; and <hi>Aſſen,</hi> as Commander in chief, ſometimes on one ſide, ſometimes on the other, without affecting much to be near <hi>Hippolito</hi> or <hi>Eleanor,</hi> by the help of the Horſe-men they had free paſſage; and were ſeveral times ſaved from being taken and carried before the <hi>Baſſa.</hi> At laſt being come to the <hi>Brigandine,</hi> they delivered the Horſes to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor'd to the owners, and having rewarded them well for their pains, <hi>Aſſen</hi> ſent them back with this Letter to the <hi>Baſſa.</hi>

Madam,</hi> anſwers <hi>Hippolito,</hi> I am ſtill a Chriſtian, and had I been threatned with Death, or with Torments, I ſhould not have changed my Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, but 'tis true I have been long thought a Turk. <hi>Aſſen,</hi> who could not conceive how it could be ſo in a Country like his, where in matters of Religion, there are Formalities not to be counterfeited, pray'd him to declare what courſe he had taken, and how it was poſſible for him to eſcape Circumciſion, being the firſt of the Ceremonies uſed in that caſe. <hi>Hippolito</hi> to ſatisfie him, knowing he ſhould at the ſame time do <hi>Eleanor</hi> a pleaſure, went on with his ſtory.</p>
                  <p>I told you formerly of the reſolution I took, of ſearching every Creek of the Mediterranean, for the Veſſel this Lady embarqued in: I did ſo for ſeven or eight months, in a little Frigat with ſix pieces of Ordinance, wherein I was at laſt taken by a Veſſel of <hi>Tripoly</hi> of no leſs than thirty Guns, after ſix hours Fight, and the loſs of almoſt all our men: I was carried to <hi>Tripoly,</hi> where they preſented me to the <hi>Baſſa,</hi> who upon the good report they gave of my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour in the Fight, uſed me very civilly, and having in few days expreſs'd no ſmall affection for me, wiſhed I would turn Turk, and ſent me for the purpoſe to a famous Cady to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed in their Faith: this <hi>Mahometan</hi> Doctor was a very honeſt man, and witty; he was the Son of a Renegado, and had leſs Faith than his Father in what he taught others; he ſpoke very freely to me, and I opened my ſelf to him, and pray'd him to make the <hi>Baſſa</hi> believe I was

turn'd Turk; he did ſo, the <hi>Baſſa</hi> believed it on his word, and expreſs'd for me more kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs than ever; but he had a Nephew who was jealous of it, and often quarrelled with me on that ſcore, which might afterwards have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced further inconvenience. The <hi>Baſſa,</hi> who had a tender love for this Nephew, foreſaw what might follow, and reſolved to part us for ſome time, till this Nephew were cured of his jealous and tempeſtuous humour; he ſent me with great Preſents to the <hi>Dey</hi> of <hi>Tunis,</hi> his intimate Friend, recommending me very earneſtly and affectionate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to him. The <hi>Dey</hi> within a week after my arrival, made me his <hi>Aga:</hi> You know <hi>Aſſen,</hi> what a ſad life <hi>I</hi> led; but who would have thought, <hi>ſays he,</hi> addreſſing himſelf to <hi>Eleanor, I</hi> was ſo near what <hi>I</hi> ſearched for, and loved a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all the World, yet knew nothing of it; and that my Fate ſhould make me ſo happy, when <hi>I</hi> was juſt upon loſing you.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Marqueſs</hi> and <hi>Eleanor</hi> entred into fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diſcourſe of their adventures; and the Maſters of the Veſſel coming to conſult <hi>Aſſen,</hi> he left them together to go on with their ſtories. The wind chopped about, and threatned a Storm, the Veſſel being ſmall, they thought it inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient to venture further to Sea: They tack'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, making towards <hi>Biſerti,</hi> intending to ſail near the Coaſt of <hi>Barbary,</hi> till they ſhould come over againſt <hi>Sardinia,</hi> that they might croſs over (as ſoon as the weather ſerved) into the Iſles of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> where they hoped to anchor. This was their reſolution, and 'twas well for them they followed it, for the Storm was ſo great,
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:60459:272"/>
they were forced to lye at Anchor three or four days among the Rocks on the Coaſt of <hi>Barbary.</hi> They were ſo far from <hi>Tunis,</hi> they had no cauſe to fear purſuit, being at Anchor in a place where a thouſand Veſſels might have paſs'd by without diſcovering them in the ſtorm.</p>
                  <p>The ſtorm at length was pretty well over, and thc <hi>Brigandine</hi> purſu'd her Voyage along the Coaſt of <hi>Barbary;</hi> meeting by the way ſeveral Creeks, floating Hogſheads, and Planks, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther pieces of broken Ships, which they doubted not were caſt away in the laſt ſtorm. For two days they cruiſed along that Sea; they were frequently entertained with thoſe lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſpectacles, and at laſt heard the voice of a Man, which they fancied muſt have come from a Rock at leaſt three miles diſtant from Land; they preſently concluded it was one e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcaped out of the late Shipwracks. <hi>Eleanor</hi> was moved to pity at the cry, and <hi>Aſſen</hi> at her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>requeſt, turn'd the prow of his <hi>Brigandine</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Rock. The Sea was then calm, and when they got within ſome paces of the Rock, they ſaw a man almoſt naked, without Hat, without Stockings, without Shoes, ſo maimed and disfigured, they knew not whether they ſhould more fear him or pity him. <hi>Aſſen</hi> having orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Sea-men to ceaſe rowing, asked him in <hi>Moreſque,</hi> how he came upon that Rock, and what he would have. I am an unfortunate Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian <hi>(anſwers he in Italian)</hi> and not unknown to you, and if you will take the pains to get foot on land here, you will find what perhaps you are in ſearch of, but you muſt loſe no time, otherwiſe
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:60459:273"/>
your help may come too late. <hi>Aſſen</hi> amazed to hear him ſpeak ſo, obſerved ſomething in his Countenance, made him think he had ſeen him elſewhere. <hi>Eleanor</hi> was particularly aſtoniſhed at his voice, and fancied ſhe knew it; but the man was ſo disfigured, ſhe could not poſſibly call to mind who he was. <hi>Aſſen</hi> asked his name, and where he had ſeen him to know him: I tell you, <hi>anſwers the man,</hi> I have here what you perhaps go in ſearch of much further; the man you ſee is <hi>Alexander</hi> the <hi>Baſſa</hi>'s Slave, and if he has ſent thee for his Wife, thou may'ſt find her on this Rock half dead with her Sufferings theſe two days we have been here: he had ſcarce done ſpeaking, but <hi>Eleanor</hi> invaded at once with joy and grief cry'd out, which made the man turn his face, and ſhe knew him to be <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander. Ha Sir,</hi> ſays ſhe, <hi>is it poſſible it ſhould be you, and not know</hi> Laura? As ſhe ſpoke thus, <hi>Aſſen</hi> having commanded the Oars to turn the prow to land, ordered a Plank from the Veſſel to the Rock, and paſs'd over it firſt, <hi>Hippolito</hi> following with <hi>Eleanor</hi> by the hand, and all to embrace poor <hi>Alexander,</hi> who was ſo transported with joy, he could not ſay a word: he pray'd <hi>Aſſen</hi> to get him ſomething from aboard to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort his dear <hi>Sultaneſs,</hi> who had not eat any thing for three days paſt. They gave order accordingly, and inſtantly ran towards the place where the <hi>Sultaneſs</hi> lay under a Buſh, where they found her half dead; a ſad ſight for <hi>Laura,</hi> yet mixt with joy to ſee her; but what an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoniſhing ſurprize was this to the <hi>Sultaneſs,</hi> who could ſcarce open her eyes, and knew not whether ſhe were awake or in a Dream, and whether
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:60459:273"/>
what appeared to her, were Perſons or Spirits. You may imagine the haſte <hi>Eleanor</hi> made to help her, being readily ſeconded with <hi>Hippolito</hi>'s aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance: <hi>What are you here</hi> Laura, ſays the <hi>Sulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> with a feeble and languiſhing tone, <hi>and am I not miſtaken? what good Angel hath ſent thee to reſcue me from the Jaws of Death?</hi> Heavens! my dear <hi>Sultaneſs,</hi> anſwers <hi>Laura,</hi> not able to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear crying, <hi>Heavens! which hath had pity on us, and delivered me alſo out of the hands of the</hi> Baſſa. The <hi>Sultaneſs</hi> began to recover, but had not ſtrength to ſpeak long. <hi>Aſſen</hi> told <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander</hi> ſhe would be better aboard than at land, the Sea being ſtill. The Count, who had not yet had leiſure to diſcourſe them, asked where they were bound for, and having under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood they ſail'd for <hi>Italy,</hi> he could not ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently bleſs Heaven for ſo happy an accident. The <hi>Sultaneſs</hi> was carried aboard, and the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther being fair, they reſolved to put out to Sea, and direct their courſe for <hi>Sardinia.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Laura</hi> was ſo careful of the <hi>Sultaneſs,</hi> that ſhe began to gather ſtrength; <hi>Aſſen</hi> and <hi>Hippolito</hi> did their part with the Count, who had no leſs need of nouriſhment and reſt: This took up one day; on the morrow the weather continuing fair, and the <hi>Sultaneſs</hi> finding her ſelf in a condition to diſcourſe, they related to her what paſs'd at <hi>Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis</hi> ſince her departure, and deſired Count <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> to inform them how they came to be wrack'd, and by what Fortune they got upon the Rock; he anſwered to this purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="192" facs="tcp:60459:274"/>You have heard without doubt, how the <hi>Sulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> was carried aboard by the <hi>Baſſa</hi>'s order, who thought (as well as I) it was <hi>Laura:</hi> You may imagine my ſurprize great, and my joy inexpreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible At our putting to Sea we had a good wind, but ſcarce paſt the Cape of <hi>Carthage,</hi> but we ſaw the <hi>Heavens</hi> cloudy on the ſudden, and had the wind in our Teeth, and ſo ſtrong a Gale, that our Veſſel being ſmall, and the ſtorm increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, we were driven on this Coaſt and caſt An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor; preſently a violent and moſt terrible <hi>Hurri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cane</hi> broke out Cables, ſet us a-drift, and caſt us upon the Rocks. I leave it to you to gueſs, what an extremity this was for a Lover, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her he loved above the World ready to be loſt before his face, which heightned to the utmoſt the terrours of danger and death: I ſtood by the <hi>Sultaneſs,</hi> who with grief and fear was already half dead; and reaching out her hand, <hi>Dear</hi> Alexander, ſays ſhe, <hi>ſince the hour is come we muſt dye, let us dye together.</hi> Theſe words ſo reſolute and kind, pierced my very heart, and turned me into a Statue, leaving me without ſence or motion. All I could do, was embracing my dear <hi>Sultaneſs</hi> for a final Adieu, when the Veſſel giving a great crack, made me turn my eyes towards the Window of my Cabin, where I ſaw a Rock almoſt touching the Poop; this ſurprized me not a little, and taking a ſudden reſolution, I placed the <hi>Sultaneſs</hi> on my back, got upon the Deck, and in ſpite of the Sea-men, who would have diverted me, I leaped on the Rock without doing my ſelf or the <hi>Sultaneſs</hi> harm. A mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment after, the Sea which caſt the Veſſel on the Rock, carried it off again, leaving me and
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:60459:274"/>
the <hi>Sultaneſs</hi> there helpleſs of help, unleſs our Sea-men would pity us, but they could not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter the winds, and the night was far gone, ſo that no good was to be expected from them till the morrow, if the ſtorm would over. A ſad night it was, the poor <hi>Sultaneſs</hi> endeavoured to comfort me with hopes the Mariners would not forſake us; but what a lamentable ſpectacle had I at break of day, to ſee ſome Leagues diſtance half a Ship a float, which by the number of People I ſaw returning from one end to another to get nearer land, was ſunk by the greatneſs of the waves, and all the men drown'd. What afflicted me moſt, was the ſight of the <hi>Sultaneſs,</hi> though ſhe, by I know not what preſage, would not deſpair of good Fortune, but would tell me ſtill, <hi>Heaven</hi> had not ſaved us from the Sea, to let us periſh on that Rock; but would ſend to our aid one of the many Veſſels that paſs'd by that way. It was a piece of good Fortune I did not expect, yet I looked conſtantly about to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſome ſail, when at laſt having almoſt loſt hope, having for two days ſeen nothing on the Sea, I ken'd on the ſudden ſomething floating on the water, but being at diſtance, and diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering no ſail, I knew not whether to think it a Wrack, or ſome ſmall Veſſel with Oars; yet ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you draw towards the Coaſt, and the nearneſs of the objects magnifying them every moment, <hi>I</hi> knew it to be a <hi>Brigandine,</hi> and brought the <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taneſs</hi> the News, who was not much pleaſed with it, fearing the Veſſel came from <hi>Tunis,</hi> and being more willing to dye on the Rock, then return thither, I hollowed, and cry'd, and had the luck to be heard by you; and if I did not preſently ex<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>preſs
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:60459:275"/>
that joy which might have been expected up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on knowing you, you will pardon it as an effect of the miſerable condition I was reduced to, and will eaſily believe it could not but be great.</p>
                  <p>Count <hi>Alexander</hi> having ended his diſcourſe, every one ſpoke his thoughts of all theſe adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, mingling ſighs with their joy, which increaſed at the news of one of <hi>Aſſen</hi>'s Servants, that he diſcerned land, and that it could be no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther but <hi>Sardinia:</hi> He was in the right, but they could not anchor till the morrow; and the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther continuing good, within eight days they ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived at <hi>Genes,</hi> to the infinite ſatisfaction of this happy company, and all <hi>Eleanor</hi>'s Friends. Her Father was dead, and thoſe who were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted with the tuition and diſpoſal of her (if heard of) were eaſily induced to conſent ſhe ſhould be married to <hi>Marqueſs Hippolito,</hi> who found means to make his Peace with the Viceroy of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.</hi> The <hi>Sultaneſs</hi> turn'd Chriſtian, and Count <hi>Alexander</hi> married her: <hi>Aſſen</hi> followed the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of the <hi>Sultaneſs,</hi> and Count <hi>Alexander</hi> as well as <hi>Marqueſs Hippolito</hi> ſerved him with their Credit and Eſtates, to make his Fortune, and live happily the reſt of his days.</p>
